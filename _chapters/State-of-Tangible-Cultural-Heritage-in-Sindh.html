title: State of Tangible Cultural Heritage in Sindh
section: 4
order: 45

<p><strong>I. Background Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Most heritage sites in Sindh are in a highly degraded and endangered state. It has become essential to task all
	relevant organizations to ensure heritage safeguarding, preservation and public outreach activities in order to
	foster pride, stake in and ownership of Sindh&rsquo;s ancient and diverse heritage dating back to the Bronze
	Age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I.0 Types of Heritage Sites&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The existing heritage of Sindh can be divided into the following groups:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li style="list-style: none;">
		<ol>
			<li><strong>World Heritage Sites&nbsp;</strong> </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>These are of global significance and need to be kept off the endangered list by following the requirements of
	UNESCO World Heritage and ICOMOS missions that provide periodic reporting.&nbsp; </p>
<ol start="2">
	<li style="list-style: none;">
		<ol start="2">
			<li><strong>Sites of National, Provincial and Local importance&nbsp;</strong> </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>These sites were originally included in the list under the Antiquities Act 1973, and many more were identified by
	the Federal Department of Archaeology. Although they are protected by law, the majority of them are not provided
	maintenance or preservation.&nbsp; </p>
<ol start="3">
	<li style="list-style: none;">
		<ol start="3">
			<li><strong>Urban Heritage Sites&nbsp;</strong> </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>These sites have been identified and provided protection under the Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act 1994.
	Many structures are under the custodianship of various government agencies, while others are under private ownership.
	A few have been restored but the vast majority are awaiting action.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0 Status of
		Legal Framework&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p>2.1 As a result of the 18<sup>the</sup>&nbsp;Constitutional Amendment, the Sindh Culture&nbsp; Department is
	custodian of all heritage sites in Sindh. In the absence of a unified law at the moment both the Antiquities Act,
	1973, and the Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act, 1994, are applicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0 Heritage Public Institutions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Government institutions that are engaged in heritage safeguarding are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3.1 Sindh Cultural Heritage Advisory
		Committee&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Headed by the Sindh Chief Secretary, the committee acts under the 1994 Act and controls the changes or
	de-notification of notified structures in urban areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Sindh Culture Department&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There are several hundred notified sites spread over all districts. The Heritage Foundation of Pakistan has
	developed an electronic databank for Sindh Heritage, which has made the current condition available of over 1100
	heritage sites in Sindh. For all heritage sites, the Sindh Directorate of Archaeology is the relevant directorate,
	but suffers from lack of trained and other personnel in order to undertake work according to international charters
	and guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Government Agencies&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>All municipal authorities and other government agencies have several historic structures under their custody. For
	example in Karachi, KMC owns Frere Hall etc., while the Education Department owns the BVS School and several other
	schools; in other districts many historic structures are under the custody of deputy commissioners and departments
	such as Education and Revenue. Urban heritage structures are also owned by cantonment boards.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Endowment Fund Trust for the Preservation of Sindh Heritage (EFT)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The EFT was established in August 2008 by the Sindh Government with a capital of 100 crores as an autonomous
	non-profit organisation. It is to be governed by a board of trustees consisting of 13 trustees (10 from the private
	sector and 3 from public sector). It has Jahangir Siddiqui as chairman, Hameed Haroon as managing trustee, and Abdul
	Hamid Akhund as secretary of the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.5 Museums&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Museums operate under the Sindh Culture Department. The National Museum carries a remarkable collection. Although
	it is open to the general public, far greater effort is required to familiarize the public with the wealth of
	collection it houses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.6 Mohatta Palace Museum&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Government of Sindh purchased this in 1995. The Governor of Sindh created the Mohatta Palace Gallery Trust on
	14the&nbsp;September 1995, with the governor as chairman of the Board of Trustees consisting of not less than six or
	more than 15 to be appointed for a 5-year term of office. The managing trustee was appointed for three years from 4
	March 1997. The Mohatta Palace Museum was formally opened in 1999. Mr. Hameed Haroon is managing trustee, and Abdul
	Hamid Akhund is secretary of the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II. Urgency of Action&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heritage Sites Requirements &amp; Related Imperatives&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Sindh heritage sites are in a highly endangered state. Unless action is taken urgently, most sites will succumb to
	degradation, pilferage and encroachments, which are occurring on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.0 MOHENJO-DARO World Heritage Site&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It is the largest Bronze Age city in the world of the Third Millennium, which is parallel to Egypt and its
	pyramids, and to Mesopotamia in significance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Indus Civilization represented by the urban layout of Mohenjo-Daro, provides
	the world with the first proto- democratic forms. Built with burnt bricks, this is the only 3rd.&nbsp;millennium site
	in the world of that is still surviving.</p>
<p>Among the main requirements spelt out by experts are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Dry Core Drilling </p>
<p>* Laboratory Improvements  </p>
<p>* Sufficient workforce for regular maintenance&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAKLI NECROPOLIS, THATTA World Heritage Site&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The largest Muslim necropolis in the world that is protected by the world community. The extraordinary history of
	Sindh over the last 500 years is reflected in its spectacular architecture, with the sepulchres of Sufis and rulers
	alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the requirements of the UNESCO/ICOMOS Missions of 2006, WHC Session 33 and 2010 Emergency Mission were
	fulfilled by the Heritage Foundation of Pakistan prior to the arrival of the 2013 World Heritage Mission, which
	consists of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>* Mapping and Detailed Registration</strong>: A map of Makli divided into Core Zone and Buffer Zone was
	prepared by the Heritage Foundation. The registration of all monuments, platforms and graves has also been completed
	by the foundation. </p>
<p><strong>* Soil Investigation, Foundations, Stabilization of Tomb of Jam Nizam Al Din</strong>: Soil investigation
	and a detailed condition survey were prepared by the Heritage Foundation. (However, stabilization of the tomb is
	still to be taken up by the relevant authorities).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;* Condition Reports and Detailed Documentation</strong>: Photo documentation&nbsp; and preliminary
	evaluation has been initiated by the Heritage Foundation. (A comprehensive effort in this direction is required to be
	taken up by the relevant authorities).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>* Prioritize Emergency Intervention, Emergency Shoring &amp; Maintenance</strong>: Lari-Emergency
	Preventive Intervention has been initiated by the foundation. (However, the large-scale effort has still to be taken
	up by relevant authorities).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Monitoring Program &amp; Management Plan</strong>: Not implemented so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following steps are considered essential to be undertaken immediately in order to keep the Makli site from
	being placed on the&nbsp;<em>UNESCO World Heritage Endangered List</em>:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>Demarcation of the Core Zone and the Buffer Zone by the Revenue Department according to the site map prepared by
		the Heritage Foundation and approved by the Sindh Culture Department.  </li>
	<li>Stabilization of the famous tomb of Jam Nizam al-Din.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Detailed documentation, damage assessment of all monuments, platforms and graves.  </li>
	<li>Systematic stabilization of all 75 standing structures and 402 platforms (identified by the Heritage
		Foundation).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Halting of all encroachments, removal of unauthorized construction and removal of unauthorized electric line by
		the District Administration.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Construction of boundary fencing to stop encroachments and pilferage.</li>
	<li>Coordination mechanism between relevant government departments for effective management of the site.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Sufficient workforce for regular maintenance and guarding.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Training.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SITES OF NATIONAL, PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL
		IMPORTANCE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Many of these sites are in far off areas and most are in a highly degraded state. There are cases of encroachments
	and pilferage with hardly any maintenance. The following actions are essential to save them from further decay:&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li>Determination of boundaries by the local revenue department and fencing to deter encroachments.  </li>
	<li>Guarding the sites from vandalism.  </li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage assessment of sites for
		developing remedial measures and emergency assistance.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Annual maintenance, conservation plans and funding allocation for heritage sites, including trained staff for
		preservation and patrolling.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Punitive action against encroachers, pilferage or misuse of sites.</li>

<p>Adequate expertise is not available to meet the challenge of heritage management and there is insufficient capacity
	in the public and private sectors for safeguarding heritage.&nbsp;</p>

	international level training courses developed by the Heritage Foundation of Pakistan / UNESCO. Training procedures
	for young professionals and artisans can be taken up through a 3-month training program to fulfill the requirements
	not only of the Makli Necropolis but also of other heritage sites in Sindh.</p>
