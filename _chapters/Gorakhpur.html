<p>I was born on Friday, 28 Shaban, 1355 Hijri in Gorakhpur where my father, Zahirul Hasnain Lari (1907-1972) had
    started practice as a lawyer after graduating from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). He was sent down from AMU for
    opposing the invitation to the English Deputy Commissioner to inaugurate the student union, of which he had been
    elected secretary. But he was hailed by Jawaharlal Nehru, who invited and took him to the All India Political
    Parties Conference at Delhi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father was elected to the U.P. Legislative Assembly on a Muslim League ticket in the first All India provincial
    elections against a Muslim Momin party candidate supported by the Congress, held in the winter of 1936-37. The
    election was fought on the basis of the Act of 1935, which was opposed by both Congress and League, but both
    participated in the elections, and later accepted it as the provisional constitution of the two new independent
    countries with some amendments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act provided for&nbsp;Dyarchy, also spelled&nbsp;diarchy, a system of double
    government&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Centre.The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy_of_India">Viceroy of
        India</a>would continue to control India&rsquo;s finances, defence, foreign affairs, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Army">British
        Indian Army</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India">Reserve Bank of India</a>and
    the Railway Board.Dyarchy, which had been established in the provinces by the Act of 1919, came to an end in the
    provinces.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma">Burma</a>and Aden were completely separated from India.<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sindh_Division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Sindh</a>was
    separated from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Presidency">Bombay</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_and_Orissa">Bihar
        and Orissa</a>was split into the separate provinces of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar">Bihar</a>and&nbsp;<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha">Orissa</a>.&nbsp;However, theparts of the Act intended to establish
    the Federation of India never came into operation.</p>
<p>The issue in the 1937 election was complete autonomy within the British Commonwealth, self-government for provinces,
    and adequate safeguards for minorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian National Congress emerged as the largest party with 707 (44.6%) out of 1,585
    provincial assembly seats.&nbsp;It won an absolute majority in six provinces, attracted enough members in two
    others to form governments in eight provinces, and became a coalition partner in three Muslim majority provinces.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India Muslim League</a>emerged as the
    second largest party in India, with 106 (6.7%) provincial assembly seats. However, it did poorly in the provinces
    that now constitute Pakistan, won one seat in Punjab, none in Sind and NWFP, and Baluchistan was not yet
    constituted a province. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India Muslim
        League</a>was part of a coalition government in Bengal. Therefore, Quaid-i-Azam presided over a meeting of the
    U.P. Muslim League Parliamentary Board on 7th May 1937 in Lucknow, in which it was decided that the Muslim League
    party in the Assembly would not merge with the Congress, but would cooperate on the basis of an agreed
    programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876-1948), who was considered an ambassador of Hindu Muslim unity, requested
    the Congress to form a government with two representatives of the Muslim League in the Muslim minority provinces of
    Bombay and U.P., where the Muslim League had won 18 (10.29%) out of 175 and 26 (11.40%) out of 228 seats
    respectively. The Muslim League performance did not impress the Congress, who agreed only if the old Congressite
    Jinnah in Bombay, and the Khilafat and Unity party veteran Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman (1889-1973) in U.P., merged the
    Muslim League parliamentary parties into Congress.Mr. Cowasjee Jehangir, who represented the Quaid and Patel on
    behalf of Congress met in Bombay, while Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman and Maulana Azad met in U.P., but to no avail. This
    annoyed Mr. Jinnah who stated, &lsquo;When the Congress Ministries were formed, the Muslim League was an anathema
    to them. The Muslim League was ordered to liquidate itself. The members of the Muslim League were told to abjure
    their allegiance to this body (Muslim League) before the Congress could even touch them&rsquo;. The Governor of
    Bombay, Lord Brabourne, reported thus to the viceroy on his conversation with Jinnah. &lsquo;Jinnah went on to tell
    me some of his plans for consolidating the Muslim League throughout India and how he is doing his utmost to awaken
    the Muhammedans ... His policy is to preach communalism morning, noon and night&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Muslim League was lucky because the Congress ministries did not last long.On 3 September 1939, British Prime
    Minister&nbsp;<a title="Neville Chamberlain" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain">Neville
        Chamberlain</a>&nbsp;announced the commencement of war with&nbsp;<a title="Nazi Germany" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">Nazi
        Germany</a>. The following day, the Viceroy,&nbsp;<a title="Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hope,_2nd_Marquess_of_Linlithgow">Lord
        Linlithgow</a>, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had&nbsp;entered the war
    along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India. The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate
    independence with a constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial
    governments resigned on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder
    of the war.</p>
<p>The Quaid asked Muslims to help the British Raj and observe a day of deliverance from the Congress ministries on 22<sup>nd</sup>December
    1939. The result was that anti-congress and pro-Muslim League ministries were formed in a number of provinces,
    which allowed the Muslim League to organize itself.</p>
<p>Jinnah took a complete somersault in politics. He had begun by being a firm believer in India&rsquo;s common
    nationality and joint electorates as the symbol of that nationality. Even when he accepted separate electorate, at
    first his idea was that the Muslims and non-Muslims after being returned to the Legislatures by separate
    electorates should join hands so that government in all provinces as well as in centre might be coalition govt. It
    was Congress, which rejected the idea because it did not believe in a combination of Indian nationalism with
    communal separatism. The Idea that about 23% Muslims should have the same share in power and authority as 77%
    Hindus, was not acceptable to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Jinnah, Hindus and Muslims were not only merely separate nations but must have separate homelands and form
    autonomous and independent homelands. He now described as India a sub-continent, which had also different Hindu
    castes between which there is no inter-dining or inter-marriage to form separate States. The present unity of India
    dates back to the British conquest and maintained by British bayonets. To those who opposed Jinnah, this was untrue
    and unhistorical as there were Hindu and Muslim kingdoms and rulers but India was never divided in Hindu and Muslim
    India. Hindu and Muslims lived together as they did now, and formed the same people politically who lived on the
    basis of talent and ability. The Villages in which the nation lived had autonomy in which Hindu and Muslims
    participated irrespective of their religion as majority of them belong to same racial stock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Jinnah referred to dangers and difficulties, which Muslims had to face since January 1939. The Vidya Mandir
    Scheme in Nagpur, the Wardha scheme, the ill treatment and oppression of minorities in the Congress governed
    provinces and and some states. The greatest danger in Jinnah&rsquo;s opinion, which Muslims faced, was the possible
    inauguration of Federal scheme under the Act of 1935. He said that up to declaration of the war, the Viceroy had
    never thought of me. But soon after received an invitation to meet His Excellency side by side with Gandhi.
    Viceroy&rsquo;s invitation was the first shock to Congress High Command and they have not recovered from that
    because every time afterward the same procedure was followed by His Excellency. Jinnah said that we stand
    unequivocally for the freedom of India. But it must be freedom for all the peoples and communities that inhabit
    this country and not one section or one caucus. I could never think that that there could be a gentleman&rsquo;s
    agreement between the Congress and Government. Providence came to our help and the gentleman&rsquo;s agreement was
    broken and the Congress went out of office. They are now sorry for it. They want to come back. But how can they do
    it now. Gandhi called me brother with the difference that brother Gandhi has three votes and poor me only one. Why
    this camouflage, why this coercion of British Government why this threat of civil disobedience Why should not
    Gandhi come out openly as representing proudly the Hindus and let me meet him as a proud representative of the
    Muslims for a settlement &hellip; We want to be arbiters of our own affairs and the future of 9 crores of Muslims
    cannot be left to others &hellip; Notwithstanding thousand years of close contact, nationalities, which are as
    divergent today as ever cannot be at any time expected to transform themselves into one nation merely by means of
    subjecting them to a democratic constitution and holding them to a democratic constitution and holding them
    forcibly together by unnatural and artificial methods of British parliamentary Statutes. What the unitary
    Government of India for 150 years had failed to achieve cannot be realized by the imposition of Central Federal
    Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinnah said that the problem in India is not of inter communal character but
    manifestly of an international one, and it must be treated as such. The only course open to us all is to allow the
    major nations separate homelands by dividing India into autonomous states. The history of the last 12 hundred years
    has failed to achieve unity and has witnessed during these ages, India always divided into Hindu India and Muslim
    India. The present artificial unity of India dates back only to British conquest and is maintained by the British
    bayonet. Out of 11 provinces 4 provinces where the Muslims dominate more or less, are functioning notwithstanding
    the decision of the Hindu Congress High command to non-co-operate and prepare for civil disobedience.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of Gorakhpur, because it then included Lar Town and village Manjharia with our courtyard house,
    and our village with mango and lychee orchards. We used to reach it on a bullock cart, as there were no roads and
    bridges, and therefore bullocks alone could wade through the agricultural fields and various waterborne hazards
    without being drowned or washed away by strong currents or heavy rainfalls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spent the long summer months chasing monkeys especially Langoors, climbing trees, running, riding and head
    bashing with goats and lambs, wrestling, playing&nbsp;<em>kabadi</em>and&nbsp;<em>gulli danda</em>with village
    boys, without any communication with the outside world. Here one of my ancestors had arrived with his nose cut for
    participating in the 1857 War of Independence against the British. He encountered a Hindu landlord, who offered him
    the village as a fee for pleading his case against the&nbsp;<em>sarka</em>r for confiscating their&nbsp;<em>riyasat.&nbsp;</em>Therefore
    our village was also known as&nbsp;<em>nak kate sahib ka gaon</em>and our peasants were Hindus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gorakhpur and the Gorkhas of Nepal derive their name from Saint&nbsp;Gorakhnath (11th century)whose&nbsp;<em>samadhi</em>shrine
    (tomb) and&nbsp;<em>gaddi</em>(prayer seat) are in Gorakhpur. He is&nbsp;the founder of an order of ascetics called
    Nath Yogis and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/311271/Kanphata-Yogi">Kanphata (ear-split)
        yogi</a>sbecause of the large rings that they wear in their ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abdul Quddus Hanafi Ghaznavi Chishti Gangohi (1456-1537), a Sufi poet and leading Chisti shaikh wrote &ldquo;Rushd
    Nama&rdquo;, a work that sought to reconcile the teachings of Gorakhnath with Chisti Sufism. Gorakhnathis
    considered immortal and invisible, an eternal sage who had been around for thousands of years watching the welfare
    of humanity, and the inspiration behind Kabir (poet and saint), Guru Nanak (founder of Sikhism), and Raja
    Bharatrihari (Sanskrit grammarian and poet).&nbsp;Gorakhnath is mentioned in the songs of all of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pity that Goraknath temple in Gorakhpur has now become the seat of intolerance and extremism and its Mahant
    Yogi Adityanath who had become chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on 19 March 2017 is a right-wing Hindutva firebrand
    and the founder of Hindu youth organistion the Hindu Yuva Vahini which is involved in communal violence and
    predicted to become prime minister of India on an anti-Muslim and anti-Christian manifesto.</p>
<p>In Gorakhpur is the town of Kasia, known, variously, in history as
    Kushawati,Kushinagar,&nbsp;Kusinagar,&nbsp;Kusinara and Kushinara.It was built as capital of the Malla confederacy
    by Kusha, son of Lord Rama.After Lord Rama&rsquo;s renunciation of the world, Kuhsa left Kushwati for Ayodhya. And
    his cousin, Chandra Ketu, son of Lakshman, took over this region.</p>
<p>H. H. Wilson made the suggestion in 1854 that ancient Kushinagar and Kasia were the same.&nbsp;After excavations the
    main stupa was exposed in 1876 AD, and a 6.10 meter long golden statue of the reclining Buddha was discovered.It
    was here that&nbsp;Buddha(the Awakened or the Enlightened)attained&nbsp;<em>mahaparinirvana</em>, or the final
    deathless state, and abandoned his earthly body, c. 483 BCE.&nbsp;Now, Kushinagar is one of the four major Buddhist
    pilgrimage destinations. The other three are:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/nepal/lumbini.htm">Lumbini</a>(birthplace
    of Buddha) in Nepal;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/india/bodhgaya.htm">Bodh Gaya</a>(place of
    enlightenment) in Mahabodhi Temple, Bihar; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/india/sarnath.htm">Sarnath</a>(first
    teaching) in U.P.</p>
<p>To the Buddhist there is the&nbsp;nobleeight-fold&nbsp;path to the&nbsp;cessation of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha"><em>dukkha</em></a>,
    that includes the virtues of Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood,
    Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.</p>
<p>About 15 kilometers, from Kushinagar is&nbsp;Pavapuri, the second capital of the Malla Dynasty, where Lord Buddha's
    contemporary Lord&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira">Mahavira</a>was born, and took his&nbsp;<em>mahaparinirvana,</em>at
    his maternal uncle's palace. Lord Mahavira, &lsquo;Great Hero&rsquo; (599&nbsp;&ndash; 527 BC), wasthe 24th and the
    last&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>,who
    established the central&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet">tenets</a>of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>,
    the oldest religion of India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jain theology states that Jainism has existed since eternity and it has no beginning and no end. The first
    Tirthankar, Rushabhdev/Adhinath, appeared prior to the Harappan Civilization. The swastika symbol and naked statues
    resembling Jain monks, that archaeologists have found among the remains of the Harappan Civilization, tend to
    support this claim. There are five basic ethical principles (vows) prescribed by Jainism:</p>
<p>Non-violence (Ahimsa) - to cause no harm to living beings.</p>
<p>Truth (Satya) - to speak the truth always in a harmless manner.</p>
<p>Non-stealing (Asteya) - not to take anything that is not willingly given.</p>
<p>Celibacy (Brahmacarya)- not to indulge in sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>Non-attachment (Aparigraha) - to detach from people, places, and material things.</p>
<p>Gorakhpur is the site of Sant Kabir Nagar, where the famous poet-saint Kabir (c.1440-1518) of the Bhakti movement
    spent his last years after he was banished from Varnasi (Banaras) in 1495. After his banishment he wrote his famous
    dohas andhe has both dargah tomb and samādhi mandir in Gorakhpur to satisfy both his Muslim and his Hindu
    followers, both groups believing that he belonged to their faith. Kabir himself wrote;</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Jogi call upon Gorakh,&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Hindus chant the name of Ram</em></p>
<p><em>Musalman say one Khuda</em></p>
<p><em>Lord of Kabir pervades everything.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Gorakhpur also contains the house where the great Urdu fiction writer Munshi Premchand (1880-1936) lived and worked
    from 1916 to 1921, and&nbsp;composed his first literary work. A park is named after him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Gorakhpur is the house where the noted Urdu poet, Firaq Gorakhpuri (1896-1982) was born. He was selected for
    Indian Civil Service but resigned to follow Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s Non-Cooperation movement, and went to jail. He
    later joined Allahabad University as a lecturer in English Literature. He wrote;</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Sakut-e-sham mitao bahut andhera hay</em></p>
<p><em>sukhan ke shama jalao bahut andhera hay&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>dayar-e-gham mein dil-e-beqarar chut gaya&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>sambhal ke dhudhane jao bahut andhera hay&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>ye raat wo ke sujhe jahan na hath ko hath&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>khayalo dur na jao bahut andhera hay&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>laton ko chehare pe dale wo so raha hay&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>kaheen zaya-e-rukh ko churao bahut andhera hay&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Also in Gorakhpur is Chauri-Chaura, where on 4 February 1922 volunteers participating in the peaceful
    non-cooperation movement of Mahatma Gandhi turned violent and burnt down the police station, forcing the Mahatma to
    call off his movement on 12<sup>th</sup>February 1922, and go on a five-day fast as penance for lives lost.</p>
<p>Gorakhpur is the home of the sweet Bhojpuri language.An estimated 70 million people in&nbsp;<a title="Uttar Pradesh"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>&nbsp;and 80 million people in&nbsp;<a
        title="Bihar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar">Bihar</a>&nbsp;speakBhojpuri. Bhojpuri Association of
    North America (BANA) claims that there are 180 million speakers in the world.It is spoken in the western Bihar, the
    northwestern Jharkhand, and the eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), as well as in the Nepal Terai.Bhojpuri is a recognized
    language in Nepal and Mauritius.</p>
<p>According to the history of Indian languages, Sanskrit language gave birth to Prakirt language and from it emerged
    seven Apabhransas (Apabhramsa, Avahansa) including Awadhi apabhransa. Bhojpuri originated from Awadhi, whereas
    Hindi is older than Hindi that developed in 15th century.&nbsp;UNO has given it a status of language but India has
    not because of political considerations.&nbsp;UNO has published declaration of human rights in 154 languages of the
    world and Bhojpuri is one of them.&nbsp;In the 1960s, the first president of India,&nbsp;<a title="Rajendra Prasad"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasad">Rajendra Prasad</a>, who hailed from Bihar, asked&nbsp;<a
        title="Actor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor">Actor</a>&nbsp;<a title="Nazir Hussain" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazir_Hussain">Nazir
        Hussain</a>to make a movie in Bhojpuri, which eventually led to first Bhojpuri film's release in 1963. Bhojpuri
    cinema history begins with the well-received film&nbsp;<a title="Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganga_Maiyya_Tohe_Piyari_Chadhaibo"><em>Ganga
            Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo</em></a>.</p>
<p>It was the headquarters of North-Eastern Railway, where the choti and bari (small and broad gauge) railway lines
    meet. The ride to mountain resorts was very interesting as the train often creaked, the engine got too hot and
    stopped at various strange places to take rest and cool down in the mountains, where people came out to breath the
    mountain air and enjoy the scenery. On one such occasion when the train stopped and people came to know that the
    Quaid-i-Azam was travelling on it, people gathered round his compartment till he came out, and Raja Saheb who was
    with him told me that one person asked him as to what would happen after Pakistan is created. The Quaid-i-Azam
    replied, &lsquo;hum badshah banega&rsquo;.</p>
