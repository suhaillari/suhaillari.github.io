<p align="center">Notice under Section 8 of the Defamation Act 2002</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I,
	Suhail Zaheer Lari, represent the Heritage Foundation and its chief Mrs. Yasmeen Lari, also my wife, who have been
	defamed and blackmailed by false, fraudulent and distorted letters and statements exchanged and reports published
	with dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous and malicious intensions to blackmail in&nbsp;<em>Dawn&nbsp;</em>newspaper
	on&nbsp;24.2.16, 27.2.16, 17.4.16, 21.4.16, 1.5.16, 10.5.16 and 13.5.16.as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>That Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund, Secretary, Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh (EFT) and
		Trustee Mohatta Palace Museum,wrote a dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous letter No. EFT/Projects/1-/2016 dated 16
		February 2016 to the Secretary of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities Department, Government of Sindh, with malicious
		intentions to blackmail, falsely and dishonestly stating that &ldquo;the Heritage Foundation has about 2-3 months
		back damaged the outer shell of the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim, Makli WHS, which damage has put the structural integrity
		of the dome at risk.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>That it was ridiculous to suggest that damage if any to a thin outer layer could in any way affect the structure
		of the huge Mughal dome. In fact there have been a number of holes/apertures in the thin outer layer of the tomb for
		decades, which can be seen in old photographs of the tomb as well as the photographs taken at the handing over the
		tomb to the Heritage Foundation in the presence of the US Ambassador and the Advisor/Minister of Culture for
		conservation of the tomb. However, Mr. Qasim Ali Qasim, Director of Archaeology &amp; Museums, Culture
		Department,Government of Sindh, replied the same day with dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous intention to blackmail
		the Heritage Foundation to Mr. Akhund vide letter No 27/3-Dams-Adam/2016 dated 16 February 2016, falsely and
		dishonestly stating, &ldquo;the Dome of Sultan Ibrahim has been damaged by M/s Heritage Foundation.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>That Mr.&nbsp;Hameed Haroon,&nbsp;Managing Trustee of the Mohatta Palace Museum, Trustee of Endowment Fund
		Trust,&nbsp;CEO of&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>Newspaper began defamation of the Heritage Foundation
		with the false,&nbsp;dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous&nbsp;report in&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 24.2.16 titled,
		&ldquo;Historical Sultan Ibrahim tomb damaged during rehabilitation work&rdquo; with theintention of blackmailing
		the Heritage Foundationby quoting Mr. Akhund and Mr. Qasim, and referring to aforesaid&nbsp;dishonest, fraudulent,
		mischievous&nbsp;letters exchanged between them on 16 February 2016 and reporting that a team would be set up to
		hold an inquiry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>That on the next day,&nbsp;Dr. Niaz Ali Abbasi, Secretary of the Culture, Tourism and Antiquities Department, on
		the basis of the aforesaid false and fraudulent&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>report, issued notification no.
		SO(G)CIBAD/TOMB/2016 dated 25 February 2016, constituting an inquiry committee of eight &ldquo;to investigate the
		alleged damage that occurred to the tomb of &lsquo;Mir Sultan Ibrahim&rsquo; at Makli during the conservation work
		undertaken by M/s Heritage Foundation Pakistan &hellip;. and stop work till the report and final decision by the
		Culture Department.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>That&nbsp;neither Mr. Akhund, nor Mr. Qasim, nor Mr. Haroon, nor Mr. Abbasi are engineers, capable of assessing
		structural damage. Also, they had no access to the tomb while the documentation and conservation work was being
		carried out by the Heritage Foundation. That the aforesaidreport in&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 24.2.16 also stated
		that, &ldquo;a UNESCO team visited the site on Feb 20 and was preparing its report&rdquo; dishonestly failing to
		state that UNESCO did not find or report any damage to the tomb by the Heritage Foundation.</li>
	<li>That Kamil Khan Mumtaz, the Chairman of the Inquiry Committee, stated &ldquo;since none of the members were
		structural experts, and the main allegation pertained to damage caused to the dome, it was essential that a civil
		engineer is made part of the inquiry committee.&rdquo; Therefore, Engineer Mushtaq Dawood was added to the
		committee, making it nine in number. That Engineer Mushtaq Dawood visited the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim and said that
		talk of damaging the tomb by the Heritage Foundation was absolute nonsense, and did not sign the report. However,
		Kamil Khan Mumtaz, the chairman of the inquiry committee, kept on falsely,&nbsp;dishonestly, fraudulently,
		mischievously&nbsp;changing his statement to defame the Heritage Foundation.</li>
	<li>That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>, dated 17.4.16 published the defamatory report falsely titled, &ldquo;Probe confirms
		damage to 15<sup>th</sup>-century tomb at Makli&rdquo;.&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>failed to report that only 3 out of 9
		members of the inquiry committee had signed the report, which amounted to a rejection rather than a confirmation of
		the alleged damage. Furthermore, since three signatures appear only on the last page of the six-page report, the
		five pages, which carry no numbers or signatures, could easily have been changed. This is clear from the statement
		of Architect Shahab Ghani Khan, one of the three signatories, who came with Architect Murad Jamil,&nbsp;and said
		that he signed the report because the chairman of the inquiry committee told him that it was against alleged damage
		and in favour of the Heritage Foundation.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.
	Mohsin S. Haqqani, Federal Secretary and Mr. Mashhood Ahmed Mirza, Joint Secretary  of the Ministry of Information,
	Broadcasting &amp; National Heritage, National History &amp; Literary Heritage Division, joined in to defame the
	Heritage Foundation by asking the Culture Department to remove temporary structures built by the Heritage Foundation
	for the purpose of training artisans and for income generating activities for the poor, who are otherwise engaged in
	begging at the Makli necropolis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated
	13.5.16&nbsp;published the defamatory&nbsp;report that the Sindh Culture Department had been asked by the Officers of
	the Federal Ministry of Heritage to remove temporary structures built by the Heritage Foundation,&nbsp;without
	mentioning that the US had&nbsp;withdrawn funds allocated to them for the preservation and conservation of Sheikhupra
	Fort, which was documented by the Heritage Foundation. That their incompetence and ineptitude lack of patriotism,
	disloyalty to heritage and to the history of Islam and Pakistan, is self evident from the innumerable encroachments
	and the building of concrete structures all over heritage sites in total violation of the commitment made by
	government of Pakistan to the UNESCO.</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That<em>Dawn</em>dated 27.2.16 made the defamatory
	report against the Heritage Foundation that, &ldquo;An amount of $ 260,000 has been provided as financial assistance
	from the US Ambassador&rsquo;s Fund for Culture&rdquo;. That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 17.4.16 repeated the defamatory
	report that the Heritage Foundation, &ldquo;received financial assistance of $260,000&rdquo; out of the US
	ambassador&rsquo;s fund&rdquo;. That Dawn dated 21.4.16 repeated the defamatory report against the Heritage
	Foundation that, &ldquo;A financial assistance of $ 260,000 has been provided from the US Ambassador&rsquo;s Fund for
	the work&rdquo; and repeated it in Dawn dated 13.5.16. Actually, the US Embassy only reimbursed the
	foundation&rsquo;s expenses. And no director of the Heritage Foundation takes any salary, share, profit or dividend
	from the Heritage Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in complete disregard of the concept of
	conflict of interest, they invited the supreme court judges to a Mohatta Palace function organized in memory of a
	legal luminary, which the former had never done before, while a human rights petition against them was pending before
	the Supreme Court. And they frightened away a lawyer by saying that they would kill, mutilate and bury Lari in Makli</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That<em>Dawn</em>, dated 24.2.16, published the
	false, dishonest and defamatory report quoting Qasim Ali Qasim and Abdul Hamid Akhund, saying that &lsquo;work had
	been carried out by unskilled labour and unqualified professionals&rsquo;. That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 27.2.16
	repeated this defamation again, quoting Qasim Ali Qasim and Abdul Hamid Akhund in saying that &lsquo;work had been
	carried out by unskilled labour under the supervision of unqualified professionals&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>repeated
	this defamatory report on 21.4.16 and 13.5.16 falsely stating that, &ldquo;unskilled labour working under unqualified
	professionals were responsible for the damage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Heritage Foundation has
	more experience of construction and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conservation work, and has more
	highly qualified professionals than all its opponents. Apart from major monuments in Punjab, KPK and Sindh, the
	Heritage Foundation has helped build over forty thousand earthquake and flood-resistant houses in over one hundred
	villages, tested and certified by NED University Lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the
	Heritage Foundation has appointed several consultants, including&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conservation architect as
	well as a consultative committee of experts, to oversee its work on the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim. The U.S. Government,
	which has funded the project, appointed their own expert from Washington to inspect the tomb regularly. And UNESCO,
	which protects World Heritage Sites all over the world, has visited Makli twice this year (in February and April
	2016).&nbsp;</p>
<p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Heritage Foundation has carried out 9 heritage projects in
	Sindh but theirfirst target is the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim, which is a project funded by the US Ambassador&rsquo;s
	Fund, because the USA is not in favour of corruption, therefore it made no provision for&nbsp;<em>bhatta&nbsp;</em>or
	largesse, which annoyed them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;the Heritage Foundation chief&nbsp;Ms. Lari,&nbsp;<em>SI, HI,</em>wrote
	to&nbsp;the Supreme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Court against the syphoning off of public funds in
	the name of heritage. Therefore it stated that all organizations created for heritage with public funds should
	appoint officers on merit through public advertisement. And all directors should be elected for not more than two
	years and not more than two terms.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it angered the aforementioned, who have acquired billions
	of public funds in the name of heritage, while historic heritage sites are encroached upon, pilfered from and
	destroyed without proper inventory, demarcation or boundary walls, They have joined with bhatta khor, and started to
	defame, libel, slander and blackmail the Heritage Foundation&nbsp;to force Ms. Yasmeen Lari,&nbsp;<em>SI, HI,</em>to
	withdraw her&nbsp;petitionbefore the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the circumstances our client demands:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>newspaper, its ceo,
	editor, publisher and printer should publish an apology to the Heritage Foundation on the front page of&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>newspaper.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the aforementioned persons should submit personal
	apologies to the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they must also make the following payments
	to the Heritage Foundation to enable it to&nbsp;continue its work to help build earthquake resistant and flood and
	rain proof houses, schools, clinics, smokeless chulas, latrines and provide clean water to poverty stricken,
	illiterate and neglected villagers of Pakistan:</p>
