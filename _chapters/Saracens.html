<p>When His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal thought of establishing an Islamic think tank, he sent me his
    paper on Science and Religion. I wrote back to him on 24 August 2000 that &lsquo;I am grateful to you for
    sending me your paper on Science and Religion. While it is true that science deals with what is verifiable, and
    rightly so, I regret to say that I cannot agree with your statement that Islam is one religion that has never
    had a quarrel with science.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity that like theologians of old, Your Highness also appears to be emphasizing not only the
    limitations, but also the dangers of science. It is this attitude, which did not allow the Saracens,&nbsp;<em>Sahranashin</em>Muslims,
    to benefit from the greatest human achievements in the field of arts and science. They inherited these when
    they vanquished two of the greatest empires, the Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) and the Sassanian (Persian
    Empire), became heirs to Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek art and sciences, and made contact with the Indians and
    Chinese. They moved toward an increasingly theologically enclosed culture that could no longer promote original
    scientific research. Not only were natural sciences spurned and labeled as foreign, but they also renounced the
    fine arts. I have discussed this in the first chapter of my book on &lsquo;Muslim Painting&rsquo;, which is
    enclosed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I also suggest that what Your Highness calls purpose in Islam is Jihad, and to be a Ghazi or Shaheed,
    and to sacrifice human lives to achieve God&rsquo;s purpose. Muslims do not have man as a measure, which is a
    product of heathen western humanism. Your Highness correctly states that Darwinism was rejected and condemned
    by some in the West, but Darwin was neither imprisoned nor tortured nor killed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe that unless we face and speak the truth about ourselves we cannot even begin to get out of the
    mire in which we have landed ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I received His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal&rsquo;s reply on 2<sup>nd</sup>September 2000 from
    Majlis El Hasan, Amman, Jordan, and among other things, he said, &lsquo;There are several reasons for the
    decline of Muslim science and technology starting in the fourteenth century. Economic factors are supreme and
    the role of theology is minimal.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realized that despite his expensive English education in Europe he was purely focused on the Saracens and had
    no knowledge of the economic and military power, and opulence and splendor of Muslim empires based on
    Samarkand, Herat, Istanbul, Isfahan and Delhi during the 14<sup>th</sup>. 15<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>and
    17<sup>th</sup>centuries under Mughals, Timurids, Ottomans and Safawids, and how they were thwarted by Islamic
    theology from modernization.</p>
<p>I therefore sent him a history of Islam written by me under the title, &lsquo;Neither Islamic nor
    Persian&rsquo;, covering the era from the Holy Prophet to the Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir, as a rebuttal to
    Western writers who describe our history as one of nation states like their own; whereas it should be described
    and understood as that of families and dynasties. The thesis of my book is that the contribution of Muslim
    Arabs (Bedouins of the desert, Sehranashin, Saracen) to civilization was oral, i. e. poetry and the Holy Quran.
    Therefore they had&nbsp;<em>Hafiz</em>to memorize the Holy Quran, whereas the Persians, whom Arabs called Ajmi
    (meaning Dumb, Mute or Barbarian) did not even have a script of their own. Therefore, when the Prophet Mani
    wanted to preach his religion to the Iranians he had to draw and paint his message to them. Today Persian is
    written in the Arabic script, and about half of its words are borrowed from Arabic.</p>
<p>The Arabs discovered the art of papermaking when the Abbasid troops captured two Chinese men near Samarkand. The
    Barmaki (Bacterian Buddhist Priest convert) minister Jaffer sought permission to establish papermaking, but the
    Muslim religious leaders opposed it. Therefore the earliest book written by Muslims on paper dates from AH
    252/AD 866, and the earliest Holy Quran written on paper so far discovered dates from AH 362/AD 972.</p>
<p>Civilization came to the Muslim world from Mawara un Nahar, i.e., the land beyond the Oxus River on the silk
    route, which linked the two great ancient civilizations of China and Greece. When Hulegu (Hilaku) Khan arrived
    at the border of the Muslim world, he asked for the names of Muslim intellectuals and chose the historian, Ala
    al-Din Juwayni (d. 681/1282), as his secretary, and the astronomer Nasir al-Din Tusi (d. 672/1274) as his
    minister. After the conquest of the Abbasid Caliphate he ordered Tusi to build, with the help of his Chinese
    engineers, the first observatory in the Muslim world, at Maragah in Iran, and appointed historian Juwayni as
    the Governor of Baghdad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The caliphs and their nobles welcomed knowledge of medicine, mathematics and astronomy, and had books on these
    subjects translated into Arabic, usually by Jewish and Christian converts to Islam, as they required the
    knowledge for their personal wellbeing as well as to run the state, But those who were madrassa educated and
    Hanbali schools were against knowledge that came from non-believers. Therefore whenever a dynasty collapsed or
    weakened, knife and fire were used to efface the wall paintings and burn the beautifully illustrated
    manuscripts. In 923, sackloads of illuminated manuscripts were burned in Baghdad. The palace library
    established by the Fatimid&rsquo;s with 18,000 works was destroyed in c. 1171. The Rashidyya Library in Iran,
    set up by descendants of Hulegu (Hilaku) Khan had sixty thousand books, and produced each year two illustrated
    copies of Jami al-Tawarikh, a universal history of mankind, one in Arabic and another in Persian. Today we have
    no trace of that library, nor do we have a copy of the illustrated universal history, which was the combined
    effort of scholars from Greece to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This hostility to knowledge and learning resulted in decay and decline, which allowed a small army of Europeans
    to subdue and dominate the Muslim world. According to Hali, &lsquo;Chua tha jis nay auj asman tak. Wo aik
    tameer kuj asar niklee&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In India, where the Muslims rebelled against the British&nbsp;in 1857 (A.H. 1274) to re-establish Mughal rule,
    the British governor of Punjab which then included KPK, was able to organize an army of Sikh, Hindu, Muslim
    Jats and Pathans, first to disband and kill the sepoys posted there and then to subdue, kill or exile the
    Muslim royals, nobles and ulemas of northern India. The great poet Ghalib wrote;</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Chauk jis ko kahen wo maqtal hay</em></p>
<p><em>Ghar bana hay namuna zindan ka</em></p>
<p><em>Sheher Dehli ka zarra zarra khak</em></p>
<p><em>Tishna-e khun hay her musalman ka&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Hujjatul-Islam al-Imam&nbsp;Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi&nbsp;(1833-1880), who established Darul Uloom
    Deoband,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Javad-ud Daula, Arif Jang, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan KCSI(1817-1898),who founded MAO College
    (later Aligarh Muslim University), had studied under Maulana Mamlook Ali in Delhi. They&nbsp;were witnesses to
    the end of the Muslim rule in India, but reacted differently.Both were devoted to the prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
    but differed in their interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna.</p>
<p>Sir Syed, who was attached to the Mughal court and had received the titles of&nbsp;Javad-ud Daula and Arif Jang
    from the Mughal King, wasadmonished by Ghalib for wasting his time on a dead era by writing Ain-e-Akbari, as
    the future was with English constitution and invention, and enmity withthe British threatened to marginalize
    Muslims of India.&nbsp;Sir Syed joined the British service and&nbsp;tried to convince the British that Muslims
    were not against them.He wrote, &ldquo;Loyal Muhammadans of India&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cause of Indian
    Revolt&rdquo;, and wrote a commentary on the Bible to prove that Islam is the closest religion to
    Christianity.To convince Muslims hereinterpreted Islam to reconcile it with Western education and science. In
    1862 he formed a scientific society, which issued a bilingual journal&nbsp;in Urdu and English. He argued that
    the Holy Quran rested on reason and natural law. His famous quote is that &rsquo;a true Muslim is one who must
    have the Holy Quran in one hand and science in the other&rsquo;&rsquo;.&nbsp;He considered both English and
    western science necessary for maintaining Muslim influence and position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Maulana Qasim Nanotvi declared jihad against the British. HefoundedDarul Uloom Deoband on May
    30, 1866, toteach revealed Islamic sciences, known as Manqulat, to the Muslim population. The
    language&nbsp;used was&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu">Urdu</a>, supplemented by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">Arabic</a>for
    theology and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language">Persian</a>for literature.</p>
<p>MaulanaNanotvi's pupil, Mahmud al-Hasan (1851-1920) organised an armed revolution against British rule known as
    the Silken Letters Movement (Reshmi Rumal Tehrik). He sent Maulana&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaidullah_Sindhi">Ubaidullah
        Sindhi</a>to Kabul, and Maulana Mohammad Mian Mansoor Ansari to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa">North-West
        Frontier Province</a>, to recruit volunteers. Mahmud al-Hasan was arrested in Mecca anddetained on the
    island of Malta, while Maulana Ubaydullah Sindhi and Maulana Mansoor Ansari went into exile in the Soviet
    Union. After his release&nbsp;from Malta In 1338/1920, Mahmud al-Hasan joined the Jami'atul-Ulama, which his
    disciples had founded in 1337/1919, and supported mass&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience">civil
        disobedience</a>for the Khilafat espoused the Ali brothers and supported by Gandhi. He laid the foundation
    stone of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Millia_Islamia">Jamia Millia Islamia</a>, a
    university founded in support of teachers and students who had quit Aligarh Muslim University established
    by&nbsp;Sir Syed Ahmed Khan,in response to a call to boycott alleducational institutions supported or run by
    the colonial regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Boleen Amman Muhammad Ali ki</em></p>
<p><em>Jan baita khilafat pay day do</em></p>
<p><em>Sath taray hay Shaukat Ali bhi</em></p>
<p><em>Jan baita khilafat pay day do</em></p>
<p><em>Burhi amman ka gham kuch na karna</em></p>
<p><em>Kalma parh kar khilafat pay marna</em></p>
<p><em>Bas yahi kam hay kar guzarna</em></p>
<p><em>Jan baita khilafat pay day do&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>These two trends are well entrenched in the Muslim world and have now come to the surface in the shape of bloody
    massacres all over the world. Those who blame the Taliban or ISIS for attacking mosques, places of worship,
    educational institutions, and their students, have either no knowledge of history or distort it
    deliberately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Taliban say, the first mosque, known as&nbsp;<em>Masjid Zirar</em>was demolished and burnt on the orders
    of the Holy Prophet. The Holy Quran Surah At-Tauba (Repentance) 9.108 states that, &lsquo;only a mosque whose
    foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your setting foot in it&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Holy Quran Surah Al-Kahf (Cave) 18.73, states that the Prophet Moses was accompanying the sage (Khizr) when
    they met a boy whom the sage killed. The Prophet Moses exclaimed, &lsquo;You have killed an innocent soul who
    had taken no life. You have done a most abominable thing&rsquo;. According to the Holy Quran Surah Al-Kahf
    18.79, the sage explained, &lsquo;His parents were believers, and we feared that he might impose upon them
    arrogance and unbelief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The third and fourth caliphs were first cousins and sons-in-law of the Holy Prophet, but were killed by Muslims
    in the name of Islam, while one of them was fasting and reciting the Holy Quran in his home at his capital,
    Medina and the other was saying his prayers in the mosque at his capital, Kufa.</p>
<p>And at Karbala on 10 Muharram 61 AH, the Holy Prophet&rsquo;s favourite grandson, Imam Husain and his family and
    followers were slaughtered by Muslims and their heads impaled on spears taken through the cities of Iraq and
    Syria to the caliph at Damascus. In the same manner the head of Karachi&rsquo;s guardian saint, Abdullah Shah
    Ghazi, a great grandson of Imam Hasan, was chopped off and sent to the caliph as proof of a loyal deed well
    done.</p>
<p>The madrassas, the nursery of the Taliban, have become the fastest growing institution since the Afghan Jihad
    against Russian occupation. While government schools have become the&nbsp;<em>autaq</em>of feudal lords, and
    teachers&rsquo; salaries are pocketed by their servants, madrassas are flourishing and providing education,
    food and clothing to children of the poor, who would otherwise lead a life of poverty and illiteracy. The
    Taliban, who are madrassa educated can often read and teach the Holy Quran and the Hadith in Arabic, and know
    Islam better than those who do not know either of these. It is the considered opinion of our ulemas that unless
    you have read the Hadith, which explains the Holy Quran with reference to the life of the Holy Prophet, you
    cannot begin to understand the Holy Quran. Therefore the Taliban cannot allow anyone to deviate from the Holy
    Quran and Sunna of the Holy Prophet, and become&nbsp;<em>Taghut</em>over their people by learning to do&nbsp;<em>git
        pit</em>in some European language.</p>
<p>When a German professor asked me as to how long Taliban killing would continue, I asked him if he remembered
    Munster. It took some prodding from me before he could remember that the German Taliban (Knights of Christ) had
    established their New Jerusalem at&nbsp;&nbsp;Munster in 1534. Their Sharia had claimed all property, burnt all
    books except for the Bible, announced their intention to capture the entire world and purify it of evil with
    the sword, in preparation for Jesus&rsquo; Second Coming and the beginning of a New Age. This resulted in
    massacres that reduced the German population by about 30%, and destroyed one third of German towns. From there
    it spread into Switzerland, the Holy Roman Empire, the Low Countries, France, Sweden and reached England where
    William Blake (1757-1827) wrote his famous poem &lsquo;The New Jerusalem&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Bring me my bow</em></p>
<p><em>of burning gold,</em></p>
<p><em>Bring me my arrows of desire.</em></p>
<p><em>Bring me my sword,</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;O clouds unfold!&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Bring me my chariot of fire!   </em></p>
<p><em>I will not cease from mental fight,&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand:</em></p>
<p><em>Till we have built Jerusalem,  </em></p>
<p><em>In England&rsquo;s green and pleasant land&rsquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The poem became so popular that it was sometimes used in place of the national anthem, and even the English King
    George III (1738-1820) said that he preferred it to &lsquo;God save the King&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The religious war petered out when Europe rejected deductive logic and accepted inductive logic, and opened the
    way to scientific method, which led to moral values. In deductive logic the reference point is a book or a
    person who is accepted as authority, whereas in&nbsp;inductive logic and the scientific method,the reference
    point is a rational human being who cannot allow anyone to do to another what he would not like to be done to
    him. This is the basis of moral values, which is of very recent origin in human history. To this end some great
    European minds played a key role.</p>
<p>The English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, and author,&nbsp;Francis Bacon&nbsp;(1561
    &ndash;1626)&nbsp;rejected deductive logic, asked people to do away with Aristotle and&nbsp;Voltaire (1694
    &ndash;1778), and&nbsp;denounced the power of the clergy.The result is that today in the West, Christ and
    Christianity can be lampooned, and plays and poems are written, and films are made making fun of Jesus and his
    disciples, because they believe in freedom of speech, and do not think that such criticism can in any way
    diminish the greatness and contribution that Christ and Christianity have made to history. But in our country
    we have the law of defamation against criticism of the Holy Prophet and his companions, as if the critical
    words or deeds of any individual can in any way devalue the greatness and contribution that the Holy Prophet
    and his companions have made to humanity and history.</p>
<p>While the western mind has broken the shackles of Greek philosophy and gone on from deductive to inductive
    logic, we are still mired in deductive logic and therefore have not discovered moral values.&nbsp;As a result
    we have religious, tribal, traditional values but no moral values, which allows the Taliban to destroy and kill
    Taghuts, as has been the case throughout Muslim history.</p>
