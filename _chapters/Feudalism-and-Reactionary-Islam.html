<p>The 1937 election had been fought on the basis of the Act of 1935. The issues then were autonomy and
    self-government for provinces, and adequate safeguards for minorities. The Agenda was secular. The Muslim
    League won only two seats in Punjab, and one of its elected members promptly left to join the Unionist Party to
    become Parliamentary Secretary in the Unionist Government of Punjab. In Sindh and the NWFP the Muslim League
    found no one to contest elections on a Muslim League ticket. In Bengal it fared better; yet it won only 27% of
    the Muslim votes and bagged 39 seats. As a result, no Muslim League ministry came into power in any province
    after the elections while the Congress Party formed ministries in 7 of the 11 provinces. The Quaid-i-Azam
    therefore felt that he had to rely on the traditional influence of the landlords and&nbsp;<em>pirs</em>and
    slogan &lsquo;Islam in danger&rsquo;, to win the election for Pakistan</p>
<p>Mr. Z. H. Lari protested against the induction of feudals and&nbsp;<em>pirs</em>into the Muslim League and
    turning it into a reactionary party. He sent a letter on 11<sup>th</sup>December 1943 to the General Secretary
    of the All India Muslim League, stating his intention of tabling a resolution at the Thirty-First Session of
    the All-India Muslim League to be held in Karachi from 24 to 26 December, 1943. He proposed that Muslim League
    ministries functioning in the Pakistan areas should devise and put into effect administrative and legislative
    measures to improve the social, educational, and economic condition of the Muslim masses. His suggestions
    were:-</p>
<p>to enforce free and compulsory education</p>
<p>to lay emphasis on vocational, technical, scientific and military instruction</p>
<p>to abolish permanent settlement wherever in force</p>
<p>to bring about peasant-proprietorship</p>
<p>to fix reasonable rent</p>
<p>to industrialize by establishing or financing cottage industries and encouraging large scale industries</p>
<p>to control industry so as to enforce a decent wage to labour and a reasonable price to the grower</p>
<p>to wipe out uneconomic debt</p>
<p>to prohibit uneconomic interest</p>
<p>to separate judicial and executive functions</p>
<p>to remove untouchability</p>
<p>to repeal un-Islamic laws</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday 23rd December 1943, Jinnah presided at the meeting of the Working Committee of the
    AIML at the Reception Committee office in the League pandal at Haroonabad. The General Secretary of the
    Reception Committee, Yusuf Haroon took Jinnah round the pandal before the meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday 24rd
    December 1943, The Working Committee of AIML concluded its two day session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinnah inspected the
    Muslim Women&rsquo;s National guard started in Karachi with 60 membersb under Mrs Yusuf Haroon, the salar.</p>
<p>Jinnah said his Jumma prayers in the Madrassa mosque</p>
<p>The All Sind Ulema conference under the presidency of Pir of Bharchandi expressed full confidence in the
    leadership of Jinnah, accepted the principle of Pakistan and assured that they would be prepared to make any
    sacrifices to achieve that object.</p>
<p>In the evening of 24<sup>th</sup>December 1943, Jinnah was taken in a two mile long procession from Lea Market
    in a chariot drawn by 30 camels and an escort of 50 chargers. It took three hours to reach Haroonabad where
    Jinnah unfurled League flag over the Pakistan Parliament. The 31<sup>st</sup>session of All India Muslim League
    commenced at night, besides a large number of delegates, about 50,000 visitors were present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proceedings started with a recitation from the holy Quran, followed by recitation of a poem by Iqbal,
    followed by a speech by the Chairman of the Reception Committee Mr. GM Syed in Urdu. He said, &lsquo;I welcome
    you all to the land of Sindhu. By Sindhu I mean that part of the Asian continent which is situated on the
    borders of the river Indus and its tributaries ... Pakistan, connotes the same old Sindhu land&hellip; Many a
    race have intermixed here. Traces of Dravidian, Aryan, Semitic and Mongol traits can be easily seen at a
    glance&hellip; The fertility of this soil has often tempted virile races to come down to this land of
    Sindhu&hellip; In this way, new blood has ever been pouring into its veins&hellip;</p>
<p>The non-Muslims of this land, in spite of the fact that they share common interests with us, are joining hands
    with the non-Muslims of Hind and want to make the inhabitants of this land slaves &hellip; under the
    circumstances, it is the duty of every Muslim of Hind to help us to make our land free and independent.
    &hellip; who for the sake of a great ideal and the&nbsp;<em>Millat</em>, would come to this land to work for
    the political and social advancement of the<em>Milla</em>t. &hellip; that from now on well-to-do Muslims of
    Hind should please direct their activities in the field of trade and commerce to this land, &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>History bears witness that in the past you have sent such gentleman as Syed Barelvi and Ismail Shaheed for these
    purposes. &hellip; If people from Gujrat and Bombay could go out to the Frontier to establish Hindu dominance
    there, could we, too, not repose some hope in you friends? Our future is interwoven with your future. &hellip;
    The inhabitants of this land mostly belong to the agricultural profession, and are very backward in trade and
    industry. Your money and experience could remove this drawback. We are prepared to afford every facility for
    this with a view to making your way easier.</p>
<p>At about 11 p.m. the Quid-i-Azam delivered his Presidential address in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second session on 25<sup>th</sup>December 1943, first resolution was moved by Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman for
    setting up of a Committee of Action.</p>
<p>The second resolution was moved by my father, Mr. Z. H. Lari&nbsp;by saying that all the Pakistan provinces now
    had Muslim League ministries; but in spite of this, the Muslims in those areas were still backward, both
    educationally and economically&hellip; The need of the hour was to abolish the class of big zamindars
    (landlords) and protect the rights of the kisans (peasants).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lari said that his resolution had four main parts;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Solid and firm Muslim ministries should be established with the help of the Muslims in their majority
    provinces.</p>
<p>(2) A practical programme should be chalked out for the economic and industrial advancement of the Muslims of
    India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) An extensive plan should be made for the educational and general uplift of the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) A five-year plan for the industrial development of the Pakistan provinces should be adopted.</p>
<p>Mr. Lari stressed that the aim of the establishment of Muslim League ministries, was not to gratify the
    political aspirations of a few individuals, but to improve the social, educational, and economic condition of
    the proletariat. He demanded that elementary education should be made free and compulsory, so that every
    inhabitant of Pakistan would benefit from the blessings of education.</p>
<p>The resolution was seconded by Mr. Tamizuddin Khan, a minister from Bengal and supported by Mr. Hamid Nizami,
    founder editor of &ldquo;Nawai Waqt&rdquo; from Punjab. In his speech, Mr. Nizami said that the Muslim League
    &lsquo;must show to the people that it was an organisation, not of landlords, zamindars and jagirdars &hellip;
    The setting up of Muslim ministries did not mean that friends and relatives of the ministers be provided with
    lucrative jobs. The ministers were there to serve the people, especially the
    poor.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nawab mohd Ismail Khan
    presided in the absence of Jinnah in the afternoon session of the Council. Several Communists, including Dr. KM
    Ashraf and Mr. RA Dange were present. The central Committee of the Communist party distribute a Leaflet which
    urged the Muslim League to become a democratic and mass organistation, demand price control and rationing so
    that food reaches all people.</p>
<p>The Quaid-i-Azam was opposed to Lari&rsquo;s resolution but was not able to persuade Zahirul Hasnain Lari to
    withdraw it. He therefore did the next best thing; he supported the resolution and took on himself the
    responsibility of appointing the members of the planning committee. The Quaid-i-Azam castigated communists who
    are now found under every flag, and questioned if the agriculturists and the producers of foodgrain are to be
    bled to father the industrialists. In the final oration of the session in which Nawab Bahadur Yar Jang used to
    sum up the Quaid-i-Azam&rsquo;s views on the conference in Urdu, he said that people who base their economic
    system on the negation of God should quit this pandal. I am sure that when our Planning Committee chalks out an
    economic system, it will be based upon the Quran&rsquo;. The Quaid-i-Azam did not want to be deflected from his
    chosen path, which was to win votes for the Muslim League and strengthen his negotiating position with the
    Congress and the British (Talbot, 1988; 49).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lord Wavell told the cabinet on 29 August 1945, &lsquo;The real strength of Mr. Jinnah&rsquo;s position was the
    widespread and genuine fear among the Indian Muslims of Hindu domination and Hindu Raj. That fear might or
    might not be well-founded but its existence and reality there could be no question&rsquo;. Sir Syed had
    observed as far back as on 14 March 1888, &lsquo;It may be appropriate or not, but no Muslim, be he a cobbler
    or a nobleman, would ever agree to the Muslims being relegated to a status where they become slaves of another
    nation, which is their neighbour, even though time has reduced them to a very low position, and would reduce
    them still further&rsquo;. The Quaid-i-Azam admitted, &lsquo;we were unconscious before the war, but now we are
    fully conscious&mdash;to expect Muslim India to agree to Akhand Hindustan and Hindu Raj... I warn you, and I
    have repeatedly warned you, they mean the independence of Hindu India and the slavery of Muslim India&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Z. H. Lari did not quit nor could he be thrown out, as he had the support of the U.P. Muslim League of which
    he was secretary general, and the Muslim League Assembly Party in the U.P. of which he was Deputy Leader. And
    as both the President of UP Muslim League, Nawab Ismail, and Leader of UP Muslim League Assembly Party,
    Khaliquzzaman, were active members of the central executive of Muslim League required by the Quaid-i-Azam to be
    in Delhi and absent from the U.P., therefore Mr. Lari actually ran the U.P. Muslim League.</p>
<p>The Quaid-e-Azam&rsquo;s two planks, Islam in danger and feudals unite, propounded at Karachi in 1943 worked in
    West Pakistan, but not in East Pakistan. East Pakistan was anti-feudal, and implemented land reform after
    independence to free Muslim cultivators from the stranglehold of big landlords who were mostly non-Muslims. The
    Muslims of East Pakistan had found the Lahore Resolution attractive for their personal and professional
    advancement, which was more relevant to them than religious and feudal considerations.</p>
