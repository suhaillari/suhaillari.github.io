<p>The Sindh Cultural Department stopped the Heritage Foundation from working at Makli, on the false charge that it has damaged the dome of Sultan Ibrahim.</p>

<p>At the back was the lady advisor/minister of culture, heritage, etc. who called two Hameeds her uncles and was once arrested with her father and mother for syphoning billions from steel mill and her photograph sitting on the floor of prison with her mother was on internet for the whole world to see.</p>

<p>Therefore Faryal asked me to get in touch with her real uncle Salman Farooqi who was with me at college. He had taken the civil service exam and had got into customs and excise but rose to become an important member of every government, first in the province and later in the centre. He ended up becoming Secretary General to the President with the status of federal minister, and received the highest award the government of Pakistan could bestow, i.e. Nishan-i-Imtiaz. He was hated for that by many, but once in power they relied on him to do the job. For example when Muhammad Khan Junejo became prime minister he was determined to keep Salman Farooqi out. Prime Minister Junejo convened a conference in Islamabad to work out plans to provide housing to the poor, in which my wife put forward the concept of a land bank for the poor. This was liked by Junejo who asked her to work out the details for him. Salman Farooqi, who was there knew that she was not going to do anything about it, as she was used to politicians asking her to prepare plans and reports which were never implemented. Therefore he arrived next week at our house in Karachi, and said that he would not leave till my wife had had worked out the whole concept for him, which she did. Whereupon he took it and presented it to the prime minister and thus mended his relationship with him; but as we expected, the plan for a land bank for the poor never materialized which did not bother Salman Farooqi whose next target was President General Zia who had a handicapped daughter and my brothers wife was a professor at a British University and especialised in handicapped children therefore he got her to do a report so that he could curry favour with President Zia.</p>

<p>Because of Faryal, I wrote a letter to Salman Farooqui about state of heritage in Sindh but knowing him I never got in touch with him and as expected when Feryal asked him he said that he never received any letter from me although I had sent letters both to his office and residence address.</p>

<p>I also wrote to PPP senator for whom we had done two Khairpur villages who was daughter of the chief minister but there was no response</p>

<p>However, UNESCO in Paris, ICCROM in Rome and US Government stood by Mrs Yasmeen Lari and the Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>The U.S. government, which funded the project, had appointed their own expert who came from Washington to inspect the tomb regularly, and said that out of 25 heritage sites funded by US Government all round the world which she monitors, the Makli work done by the Heritage Foundation was the best.</p>

<p>UNESCO, which is the protector of World Heritage Sites, visited Makli, inspected the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim, found no damage, and asked the Heritage Foundation to work on the revival of kashi tiles, which have been pilfered regularly from Makli and other monuments under protection of the provincial and federal departments of culture and antiquities. The Heritage Foundation moved with UNESCO experts from Italy to a nearby village where it built new structures, and kilns for Italian ceramic experts sent by UNESCO to impart their knowledge to the artisans of Sindh. The workshop had to be conducted in heat and dust, while the air conditioned rest house in Makli built to house such experts working there remained empty.</p>

<p>And Mr. Simon Warrack, expert from ICCROM in Rome which monitors all the heritage work all over the world, visited the site to provide an independent assessment and found no damage to the dome as alleged by the twin Hameed mates, Akhund and Haroon, and Department of Culture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Sindh Department of Culture after change of Chief Minister and the cabinet allowed the Heritage Foundation to complete its projects funded by Americans and Germans in World Heritage Site Makli and UNESCO project on revival of Kashi before they visited the UNESCO Conference on Heritage.</p>

<p>It was a relief to the Heritage Foundation but what about Heritage.</p>
