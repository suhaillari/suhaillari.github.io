<p>The&nbsp;Bengal Famine of 1943 in which out of a population of 60.3 million, an estimated 2.1&ndash;3 million
    died of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation">starvation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria">malaria</a>and
    other diseases during 1943 and 1944. According to white Paper, Bengal famine was due to the hoarding resulting
    from fall of Burma, the air raids on Calcutta, the cyclone of October 1942 and the floods, which breached the
    main railway lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Japanese campaign for Burma began in late December 1941, which set off an exodus of more than half of the
    Indians then living in Burma into India.&nbsp;The influx of refugees created demand for more food, clothing and
    medical aid, straining the resources of the province of Bengal.</p>
<p>On 26 April 1942, Allied forces were ordered to retreat from Burma into India. The troops arrived: pushing the
    refugees aside, laying hands on all supplies, and utilizing all available transport. Japanese warships and
    aircraft sunk merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal, which put additional strain on the railways. The&nbsp;<a
        title="Quit India Movement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit_India_Movement">Quit India</a>&nbsp;movement
    also targeted road and rail link.</p>
<p>The Japanese attack provoked a scramble for rice across India, but also sparked dramatic and unprecedented price
    inflation in rice producing regions of India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fall of Burma brought Bengal close to the war front. The major urban areas (most especially Calcutta)
    swelled with ever-increasing numbers of workers in the military industries. Unskilled labourers from Bengal and
    nearby provinces were employed by military contractors for numerous projects, particularly the construction of
    American and British airfields. These enormous public expenditures increased demand, leading to price inflation
    across India, especially in Bengal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of troops arrived into the province from the United States, United Kingdom, India and
    placing further strains on domestic supplies and resulting in local scarcities across a wide range of daily
    necessities. Nearly the full output of India's cloth, wool, leather and silk industries were sold to the
    military.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of 1942, cloth prices had more than tripled from their pre-war levels; they had more than quadrupled
    by mid-1943.&nbsp;Much of the goods left over for civilian use were purchased by speculators.&nbsp;The
    hardships of the crisis was not alleviated until military forces began distributing relief supplies; for
    example, the&nbsp;<a title="United States Army Air Forces" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces">United
        States Army Air Forces</a>&nbsp;flew 100 tons of warm clothing into eastern Bengal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The military buildup caused massive displacement of Bengalis from their homes. Farmland purchased for airstrip
    and camp construction is "estimated to have driven between 30,000 and 36,000 families (about 150,000 to 180,000
    persons) off their land". The urgent need for housing for the massive influx of workers and soldiers from 1942
    onward also created problems. Military barracks were scattered around Calcutta<u><sup>.</sup></u>A thousand
    homes, including entire villages, were requisitioned for military use and at least 60,000 occupants
    expelled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The British military authorities feared that the Japanese would invade British India via the eastern border of
    Bengal. As a preemptive measure, they launched a&nbsp;<a title="Scorched-earth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched-earth">scorched-earth</a>&nbsp;initiative
    in eastern and coastal Bengal to prevent or impede the invasion by denying access to food supplies, transport
    and other resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, a "denial of rice" policy was carried out in southern districts along the coast of the Bay of
    Bengal&nbsp;that were expected to have surpluses of rice.&nbsp; The fraudulent, corrupt and coercive practices
    by the purchasing agents removed far more rice than officially recorded, not only from designated districts,
    but also in unauthorised areas, suggests a greater impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a second prong, a "boat denial" policy was designed to deny Bengali transport to any invading Japanese army.
    Under this policy, the Army confiscated approximately 46,000 rural boats,&nbsp;severely disrupting river-borne
    movement of labour, supplies and food, and compromising the livelihoods of boatmen and fishermen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many&nbsp;<a title="Presidencies and provinces of British India" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India#Provinces_of_India_(1858%E2%80%931947)">Indian
        provinces</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Princely state" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state">princely
        states</a>&nbsp;imposed inter-provincial trade barriers beginning in mid-1942, preventing other provinces
    from buying domestic rice. Provincial governments began erecting trade barriers that prevented the flow of food
    grains (especially rice) and other goods between provinces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 1942,&nbsp;<a title="Punjab Province (British India)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Province_(British_India)">Punjab</a>&nbsp;banned
    exports of wheat. The&nbsp;<a title="Central Provinces" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Provinces">Central
        Provinces</a>&nbsp;prohibited the export of food grains outside the province two months later.&nbsp;<a title="Madras Presidency"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency">Madras</a>&nbsp;banned
    rice exports in June, followed by export bans in Bengal and its neighboring provinces of&nbsp;<a title="Bihar Province"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Province">Bihar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Orissa Province" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orissa_Province">Orissa</a>&nbsp;that
    July.&nbsp;Bengal was unable to import domestic rice; this policy helped transform market failures and food
    shortage into famine and widespread death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The food member of the Indian Government said that that there was a huge surplus of food grains in the Punjab,
    but the grain is not coming from the villages, because zamindars believe that sooner or later their wheat would
    be purchased at a very high rate. On Wednesday 8th September 1943, Mr. Suhrawardy, Minister of Civil Supplies,
    Bengal, arrived at Lahore by Frontier Mail to attend the food conference, between Bengal, Punjab and Central
    government.</p>
<p>On 29<sup>th</sup>October 1943, Major General Wakely flew from Patna to Calcutta to take charge of the movement
    of food grains. Maj. Gen. R Richardson proceeded to Calcutta to take other help like Army medical and other
    stores. Arrangement was made to dispatch, 70,000 tons of wheat excluding wheat from Punjab and Australia;
    40,000 tons of barley; 15,000 tons of millets, and 10,000 tons of gram.</p>
<p>On Monday 1<sup>st</sup>November 1943, 178 sick destitute were admitted to the hospitals in Calcutta and suburbs
    and 76 died. Deaths from all causes in Calcutta during the week ending 30<sup>th</sup>October 1943, totaled
    2,214, compared with 2,155 in the previous week, 581 in the corresponding week last year &hellip; There were
    152 cases of cholera this week of which 67 proved fatal, as against 296 and 102, respectively, of the previous
    week &hellip; Deaths of paupers during the period numbered 1,306 against 1361 in the previous week, the total
    number of paupers from 1<sup>st</sup>August to 30<sup>th</sup>October being 10,631.</p>
<p>Central Province offered 10,000 tons of rice, of which 5,000 tons have been allotted to Bengal and the remainder
    to Bombay, Travancore and Cochin &hellip; CP has also declared surplus of 5000 tons of millets plus 6000 tons
    of millets from the Punjab states, has been allotted to Bombay, Madras, Mysore and the Deccan states.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 2<sup>nd</sup>November 1943, 110 bodies of sick destitute were disposed of in Calcutta. On Wednesday
    3 November 1943, the number of corpses of sick and destitute disposed of in Calcutta totaled 100 &hellip; The
    total number of Hindu dead bodies picked up from the streets of Dacca in the month of October is 121 &hellip;
    The total number of Muslim dead bodies picked up from streets of Dacca from 19<sup>th</sup>September to 31
    October is 373 &hellip; The total number of admissions of starvation cases in the Comilla Saddar Hospital upto
    31<sup>st</sup>October 1943 was 1378. The number of deaths totaled 248 &hellip; A trade in destitute girls aged
    3 to 12 in the prostitute quarters at the rate of 10 annas to Rs. 1-8 each.</p>
<p>On Wednesday 3 November 1943, In Commons debate Sir Alfred Knox said that he was convinced that the cause of the
    present position in India was economic nationalism &ndash; the jealousy and determination of the different
    provinces of India to save their own people, to keep their reserves of grain, and not let them to province,
    which had deficits. Surely, it was the duty of the Government of India to override that, and force government,
    which had excesses to give up their grain to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sir George Schuster said that there had been a failure to take adequate and comprehensive action. It was a story
    of half measures and vacillations &hellip; He would put first the necessity of introducing a comprehensive and
    coherent policy&nbsp;- an All India policy covering finance, prices and rationing. Secondly, he urged that the
    British Government should give every possible assistance in allowing India to import wheat &hellip; The Food
    Department should have been set up a year or two earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Cove (Labour), said, the war has provided an acid test of our rule in India. We have been there for 200
    years, and when a war of this character breaks out, our machinery in India, so far as morale etc. is concerned,
    has broken down. We have lamentably failed.</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley (Labour) said there was a complete absence of any ability to comprehend the consequences of the
    situation and to deal with them. The powers now being used could have been used with greater effect months ago
    &hellip; The inescapable and uncomfortable fact remained that they were dealing with a normally heavily
    undernourished people. The mass of the people had been living at an economic and nutritional level to which
    human beings should never be subject. It was an astonishing fact that despite greatly increased knowledge of
    scientific methods of agriculture, the total agricultural production in India remained static.</p>
<p>Mr. Godfrey Nicholson (Conservative) said: It is a disgrace to us that we have so allowed an administration to
    deteriorate that such a thing came about.</p>
<p>Winding up the debate Sir John Anderson revealed that in 1942 government of India made an urgent appeal for help
    in procuring additional supplies of wheat. At that time a decision had just been taken to divert certain ships
    earmarked for military purposes in order that they might be put on the North Atlantic route to improve the
    British food supply position, which was then seriously running down. It was decided, nevertheless that a number
    of those ships should be again diverted to meet India&rsquo;s requirements. This year further urgent appeals
    were received from the Government of India on the ground of very serious situation developing in Bengal. Action
    was taken, as a result of which supplies of grain were now flowing freely into Bengal. That process will go on
    until the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Seymore Cocks (Labour) said that the people of India were subjects of the King-Emperor just as the people of
    London, and if they were dying in Calcutta, it was the same thing as if they were dying in London &hellip; it
    was very important that wheat should be sent to India even if it involved three or six months of war with
    Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the week ending 6<sup>th</sup>November 1943, deaths from all causes in Calcutta numbered 1875 compared to
    2214 for the previous week. There were 100 attacks and 51 deaths from Cholera, as against 152 and 67 in the
    previous week. 526 paupers died in the week as against 1734 in the preceding week &hellip; Gen. Auchenleck
    revealed that several thousand troops were employed on this work including motorized units. Nine hundred tons
    of food is being sent daily from Calcutta, to about 20 distributing centres in the mofussel. Besides preventing
    looting of food in transmission, troops help in unloading, and storing food &hellip; Two-third of units were
    motorized and could use their own transport to carry grain &hellip; a casuality clearing station which is a
    large hospital, several field ambulances which are mobile hospitals &hellip; Army was feeding its own labour in
    Bengal, Bihar and Orissa including 50,000 men, women and children in Bengal alone, the issue of rice to British
    troops had been stopped, the issue to Indian troops had been cut by two-thirds and atta had been substituted
    for rice.</p>
<p>The first batch of Bengal orphans, numbering 64, left Calcutta for Punjab on Monday night by the Howrah Express.
    At Lahore, the orphans will be kept in Vedic Ashram, Krishma Nagar. They will be medically examined and then
    sent to different orphanages in the province. Another batch will leave Calcutta on Friday.</p>
<p>Permits for 30 wagons have been obtained by the APP Sabha, and the wagons will be loaded from different stations
    for dispatch to Howrah. A batch of Volunteers left Lahore for Calcutta on Tuesday to make arrangements for free
    kitchens in the moffasil areas.</p>
<p>Nawab of Mamdot, President of the Punjab Provincial Muslim League has opened the Bengal relief Fund under the
    auspices of the Punjab Muslim League. Mamdot has donated Rs. 5,000 to it.</p>
<p>On Saturday 13<sup>th</sup>November 1943, Mr. Shambhudayal Misra, a Congress member of Central assembly, moved
    that public trial of Lord Linlithgow, Mr. Amery and Sir John Herbert be held in connection with the Bengal
    crisis &hellip; KB Lal (nationalist) urged the appointment of a committee, consisting of officials and
    non-officials to inquire I the condition prevailing in the country and to suggest remedies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On Monday 15<sup>th</sup>November 1943, Over 100,000 infants and nursing mothers in the worst affected areas in
    Bengal are being given milk daily out of supplies made available by the Red Cross &hellip; The Government of
    Bengal has purchased five lakhs lbs., of condensed milk and five lakhs of powered milk from South Africa.
    Besides the British Admiralty is transferring nine lakhs lbs. of American milk to Bengal.</p>
<p>On Wednesday 22<sup>nd</sup>December 1943, It was suggested that instead of the Sindh Ministry&rsquo;s proposal
    to buy and sell rice at Rs. 12 per maund, the Sindh Government should buy rice at Rs. 9 as at present, and sell
    to other provinces at Rs.12. Mr. M H Gazdar, Minister for information, Sind, said not speculators and vested
    interests but the entire province is crying for the increase. The rural population forming the bulk of growers
    would not be affected by the rise.</p>
<p>On Monday 15<sup>th</sup>November 1943, Fifty-seven destitute died in various Hospitals in Calcutta. 63 dead
    bodies were disposed off by Hindu Satkar Samity and the Anjuman Mafidul Islam &hellip; 68 destitute died on
    Sunday.</p>
<p>On Friday 19<sup>th</sup>November 1943, The Council of State began three day debate on the food situation
    &hellip; revised plan has come into operation on 1<sup>st</sup>August 1943 &hellip; During three months of its
    operation &hellip; principal recipient had been Bengal 300,300 tons; Bombay 84,000 tons; Madras 79,200 tons;
    Travancore and Cochin 51,300 tons; and the Deccan states 6,500 tons.</p>
<p>SIR AP Petro regretted that the famine had been made the sport of politics in Bengal. He thought that two
    parties were fighting for power and the result was that people were starving.</p>
<p>Till 1<sup>st</sup>December 1943, a total of 15,886 sick destitute were admitted in the different hospitals of
    Calcutta&rsquo;s industrial areas, of whom 5,989 died and 7974 were discharged.</p>
<p>On Friday 3rd December 1943, Amery replying to a question said, Military assistance in Bengal is getting into
    its stride and outlying centres as well as Calcutta are now receiving adequate supplies, though distribution
    from these centres to more remote villages still present a problem. Plans for rationing in urban areas are
    proceeding and should be in operation in Calcutta by middle of this month. Deaths in Calcutta, during the
    fortnight ending 28<sup>th</sup>October totaled 3,132 &hellip; it is reported that 2,233,000 people are being
    fed daily from food kitchens &hellip; a serious outbreak of Cholera in Bengal has followed upon the famine.
    During October deaths in the province from this disease averaged 5,349 per week. In the first week of November
    they were 4,464. The Army is providing assistance in the provision of Doctors and medical equipment and a mass
    inoculation campaign is being planned.</p>

    promptly, including a full&nbsp;<a title="Division (military)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)">division</a>&nbsp;of
    15,000 British soldiers, military&nbsp;<a title="Truck" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck">lorries</a>&nbsp;and

    and distribution to even the most distant rural areas began on a large scale.&nbsp;In particular, grain was
    imported from&nbsp;<a title="The Punjab" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punjab">the Punjab</a>, and
    medical resources were made far moreavailable.&nbsp;Rank-and-file soldiers, who had sometimes disobeyed orders
    to feed the destitute from their rations,&nbsp;were held in esteem by Bengalis for the efficiency of their work
    in distributing relief.&nbsp;That December, the largest [rice] paddy crop ever seen, in Bengal was harvested,
    and the price of rice began to fall. Wavell made several other key policy steps, including promising that aid
    from other provinces would continue to feed the Bengal countryside, setting up a minimum rations scheme, and
    prevailing upon Great Britain to increase international imports. He has been widely praised for his decisive
    and effective response to the crisis. All official food relief work ended in January 1944.</p>
