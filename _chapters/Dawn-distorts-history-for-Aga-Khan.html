<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>newspaper published on Saturday 3 June 2017 a full page on &lsquo;Genesis Dhakka 1906: the
    All India Muslim League&rsquo;, with three rows of photographs and one row of text distorting the history
    of&nbsp;the All India Muslim League. The actual facts are as follows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwaja_Salimullah">Nawab Khwaja Salimullah</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Nawab_Family">Nawab
        of Dhaka</a>,had sponsored the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference from 27 to 29 December, 1906 in
    Dacca, which was capital ofthe separate Muslim majority province of East Bengal and Assam,&nbsp;createdon 16
    October 1905, and Hindus were agitating against it.The conference decided to hold a political session on 30
    December 1906.</p>
<p>Nawab Salimullah proposed the name of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab_Viqar-ul-Mulk">Nawab
        Viqar-ul-Mulk</a>,&nbsp;who was unanimously elected chairman of the inaugural session on 30 December 1906.
    Nawab Salimullah proposed a political organization of Muslims, named&nbsp;<em>All India Muslim League.&nbsp;</em>It
    wasseconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan. The stalwarts of the Aligarh movement and the Urdu Defence
    Association,&nbsp;Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulkand&nbsp;Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk,were nominated joint conveners of the All
    India Muslim League to frame a constitution.</p>
<p>The second meeting of&nbsp;the All India Muslim League&nbsp;was held in Karachi on 29 and 30<sup>th</sup>December
    1907.&nbsp;Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulkhad died by then, and&nbsp;Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk proposed that Sir Adamjee
    Peerbhoy, who had donated Rs. 1,10,000/- to Science College at Aligarh, be elected president. Nawab Ali
    Chaudhry and Mian Muhammad Shah Din seconded and supported the move and Peerbhoy was elected President
    of&nbsp;the All India Muslim League.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third meeting of&nbsp;the All India Muslim Leaguewas held in Aligarh on 18 and 19 March 1908. Mr.
    Fazl-i-Husain proposed and Mr. Muzamil-ullah Khan seconded the name of Mr. Muhammad Shah Din, who was
    unanimously elected president. Rs. 500 was received from H.H. Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, the Aga Khan, from
    which Rs. 50 was deducted as his admission and membership fee of&nbsp;the All India Muslim League, and Maulvi
    Rafiuddin Ahmed proposed and Mian Muhammad Shafi seconded, supported by Haji Muhammad Khan, that His Highness
    Sir Aga Khan, G.C.I.E., be elected President of the All India Muslim League. The resolution was unanimously
    adopted and communicated to His Highness by wire.</p>
<p>The fourth meeting of&nbsp;the All India Muslim Leaguewas held in Amritsar on 30 and 31 December 1908, where
    Syed Ali Imam was elected president.</p>
<p>The fifth meeting of&nbsp;the All India Muslim Leaguewas held in Delhi on 29 and 30 January 1910 where H.H. the
    Aga Khan made an appearance and proposed Sir Ghulam Ali Khan Bahadur, K.C.I.E., the Prince of Ascot, as
    president.</p>
<p>Now the first requirement of becoming president of an organization is to pay the membership fee and become a
    member. The second requirement is that the person should be proposed, third is that he should be seconded,
    fourth is that he should be elected. All this took place in March 1908 at Aligarh. The fifth requirement is
    that such a person should accept it. However this did not take place therefore Ali Imam was elected president
    of the All India Muslim League in December 1908 in Amritsar.</p>
<p>The Aga Khan in his biography confirms that he was not present in Dacca. Actually the Aga Khan wanted harmonious
    relations between various religious communities, and considered Muslim League to be communal. He supported
    &lsquo;the All-India Muslim Conference&rsquo;, that held its meeting in New Delhi on 1 January 1929 and in
    Simla on 8 September 1929, to organize a deputation to London under the Aga Khan&rsquo;s leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The All India Muslim League held it&rsquo;s meeting the same year in Delhi on 3 March 1929 and on 30 March 1929
    with Muhammad Ali Jinnah as president.</p>
<p>In the light of the above facts the two group photos taken at Dacca in 1906 published by&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>do
    not represent the meetings of the All India Muslim League, and H.H. the Aga Khan did not become a member till
    1908. Nor did he make an appearance at a meeting of&nbsp;the All India Muslim Leaguetill January 1910,
    yet&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>includes his photograph in &lsquo;Genesis Dhakka 1906: the All India Muslim
    League&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, the first office bearers of&nbsp;the All India Muslim League were joint conveners,&nbsp;Nawab
    Mohsin-ul-Mulkand&nbsp;Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk, and the first president was&nbsp;Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy.</p>
<p>Sir Adamjee Peerbhoywas born on 13 Auguest 1846&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title="Dhoraji" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhoraji">Dhoraji</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a

    the "rags to riches" stories who by his untiring efforts and ability, by the turn of the 19th century became
    one of India's largest cotton manufacturers and wealthiest men.</p>
<p>Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy was also a philanthropist. When plague hit various parts of Bombay in 1892, heappointed
    doctors, arranged for vaccines and medicines from abroad and treated the public free of cost at the Amanbai
