<p>The <em>Dawn</em> newspaper published on Saturday 3 June 2017 a full page on &lsquo;Genesis Dhakka 1906: the All
    India Muslim League&rsquo;, with three rows of photographs and one row of text distorting the history of the All
    India Muslim League and freedom struggle. The actual facts are as
    follows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwaja_Salimullah">Nawab Khwaja Salimullah</a>, the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Nawab_Family">Nawab of Dhaka</a>, had sponsored the All India
    Muhammadan Educational Conference from 27 to 29 December, 1906 in Dacca, which was capital of the separate Muslim
    majority province of East Bengal and Assam, created on 16 October 1905, and Hindus were agitating against it. The
    conference decided to hold a political session on 30 December 1906.</p>

<p>Nawab Salimullah proposed the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab_Viqar-ul-Mulk">Nawab
        Viqar-ul-Mulk</a>, who was unanimously elected chairman of the inaugural session on 30 December 1906. Nawab
    Salimullah proposed a political organization of Muslims, named <em>All India Muslim League. </em>It was seconded by
    Hakim Ajmal Khan. All delegates to the educational conference were registered as members of the proposed party. The
    stalwarts of the Aligarh movement and the Urdu Defence Association, Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Nawab
    Viqar-ul-Mulk,<strong> </strong>were nominated joint conveners of the All India Muslim League to frame a
    constitution.</p>

<p>The second meeting of the All India Muslim League was held in Karachi on 29 and 30th December 1907. Nawab
    Mohsin-ul-Mulk had died by then, and Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk proposed that Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, who had donated Rs.
    1,10,000/- to Science College at Aligarh, be elected president. Nawab Ali Chaudhry and Mian Muhammad Shah Din
    seconded and supported the move. Thus Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy was elected first president of the All India Muslim
    League at Karachi on 29 December 1907.</p>

<p>The third meeting of the All India Muslim League was held in Aligarh on 18 and 19 March 1908. Mr. Fazl-i-Husain
    proposed and Mr. Muzamil-ullah Khan seconded the name of Mr. Muhammad Shah Din, who was unanimously elected
    president. Rs. 500 was received from H.H. Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, the Aga Khan, from which Rs. 50 was deducted as
    his admission and membership fee of the All India Muslim League, and Maulvi Rafiuddin Ahmed proposed and Mian
    Muhammad Shafi seconded, supported by Haji Muhammad Khan, that His Highness Sir Aga Khan, G.C.I.E., be elected
    President of the All India Muslim League. The resolution was unanimously adopted and communicated to His Highness by
    wire.</p>

<p>The fourth meeting of the All India Muslim League was held in Amritsar on 30 and 31 December 1908, where Syed Ali
    Imam was elected president.</p>

<p>The fifth meeting of the All India Muslim League was held in Delhi on 29 and 30 January 1910 where H.H. the Aga Khan
    made an appearance and proposed Sir Ghulam Ali Khan Bahadur, K.C.I.E., the Prince of Ascot, as president.</p>

<p>Now the first requirement of becoming president of an organization is to pay the membership fee and become a member.
    The second requirement is that the person should be proposed, third is that he should be seconded, fourth is that he
    should be elected. All this took place in March 1908 at Aligarh. The fifth requirement is that such a person should
    accept it. However this did not take place therefore Ali Imam was elected president of the All India Muslim League
    in December 1908 in Amritsar.</p>

<p>The Aga Khan in his biography confirms that he was not present in Dacca. Actually the Aga Khan wanted harmonious
    relations between various religious communities, and considered Muslim League to be communal. He supported
    &lsquo;the All-India Muslim Conference&rsquo;, that held its meeting in New Delhi on 1 January 1929 and in Simla on
    8 September 1929, to organize a deputation to London under the Aga Khan&rsquo;s leadership.</p>

<p>The All India Muslim League held it&rsquo;s meeting the same year in Delhi on 3 March 1929 and on 30 March 1929 with
    Muhammad Ali Jinnah as president.</p>

<p>In the light of the above facts the two group photos taken at Dacca in 1906 published by <em>Dawn</em> do not
    represent the meetings of the All India Muslim League, and H.H. the Aga Khan did not become a member till 1908. Nor
    did he make an appearance at a meeting of the All India Muslim League till January 1910, yet <em>Dawn</em> includes
    his photograph in &lsquo;Genesis Dhakka 1906: the All India Muslim League&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Actually, the first office bearers of the All India Muslim League were joint conveners, Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk and
    Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk, and the first president was Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy.</p>

<p>Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy was born on 13 Auguest 1846 at&nbsp;<a
