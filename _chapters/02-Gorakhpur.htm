I was born on Friday, 28 Shaban, 1355 Hijri in Gorakhpur where my father, Zahirul Hasnain Lari (1907-1972) had started practice as a lawyer after graduating from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). He was sent down from AMU for opposing the invitation to the English Deputy Commissioner to inaugurate the student union, of which he had been elected secretary. But he was hailed by Jawahar Lal Nehru, who invited and took him to the All India Political Parties Conference.&nbsp;</p> <p>My father was elected to the U.P. Legislative Assembly on a Muslim League ticket in the first All India provincial elections, held in the winter of 1936-37. The election was fought on the basis of the Act of 1935, which was opposed by both Congress and League, but both participated in the elections, and later accepted it as the provisional constitution of the two new independent countries with some amendments.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act provided for Dyarchy at the Centre.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy_of_India">Viceroy of India</a>, would continue to control India&rsquo;s finances, defence, foreign affairs, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Army">British Indian Army</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India">Reserve Bank of India</a>&nbsp;and the Railway Board.&nbsp;Dyarchy, which had been established in the provinces by the Act of 1919, came to an end in the provinces.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma">Burma</a>&nbsp;and Aden were completely separated from India.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sindh_Division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Sindh</a>&nbsp;was separated from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Presidency">Bombay</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_and_Orissa">Bihar and Orissa</a>&nbsp;was split into the separate provinces of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar">Bihar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha">Orissa</a>.&nbsp;However, the&nbsp;parts of the Act intended to establish the Federation of India never came into operation.</p> <p>The issue in the 1937 election was complete autonomy within the British Commonwealth, self-government for provinces, and adequate safeguards for minorities.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian National Congress emerged as the largest party with 707 (44.6%) out of 1,585 provincial assembly seats.&nbsp;It won an absolute majority in six provinces and attracted enough members in two others to form governments in eight provinces, also becoming coalition partner in three Muslim majority provinces.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India Muslim League</a>&nbsp;emerged as the second largest party in India, with 106 (6.7%) provincial assembly seats. However, it did poorly in the provinces that now constitute Pakistan, winning one seat in Punjab but none in Sind and NWFP, while Baluchistan was not yet constituted a province. The result was that the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India Muslim League</a>&nbsp;failed to form a government in any province. The Quaid-i-Azam presided over a meeting of the U.P. Muslim League Parliamentary Board on 7th May 1937 in Lucknow, in which it was decided that the Muslim League party in the Assembly would not merge with the Congress, but would cooperate on the basis of an agreed programme.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876-1948), who was considered an ambassador of Hindu Muslim unity, requested the Congress to form a government with two representatives of the Muslim League in the Muslim minority provinces of Bombay and U.P., where the Muslim League had won 18 (10.29%) out of 175 and 26 (11.40%) out of 228 seats respectively. The Muslim League performance did not impress the Congress who agreed only if the old Congressite Jinnah in Bombay, and the Khilafat and Unity party veteran Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman (1889-1973) in U.P., merged the Muslim League parliamentary parties into Congress.&nbsp;Detailed discussion took place between Cowasjee Jehangir, who represented the Quaid and Patel in Bombay, and Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman and Maulana Azad in U.P. - but was of no avail. This annoyed Mr. Jinnah who stated, &lsquo;When the Congress Ministries were formed, the Muslim League was an anathema to them. The Muslim League was ordered to liquidate itself. The members of the Muslim League were told to abjure their allegiance to this body (Muslim League) before the Congress could even touch them&rsquo;. The Governor of Bombay, Lord Brabourne, reported thus to the viceroy on his conversation with Jinnah. &lsquo;<em>Jinnah went on to tell me some of his plans for consolidating the Muslim League throughout India and how he is doing his utmost to awaken the Muhammedans ...&nbsp;<strong>His policy is to preach communalism morning, noon and night&rsquo;.</strong></em></p> <p>The Muslim League was lucky because the Congress ministries did not last long, as the Congress objected to the viceroy declaring India at war with Germany on 3rd September 1939, and the viceroy called on Congress ministries on 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;October 1939 to resign.&nbsp; The Quaid asked Muslims to help the British Raj and observe a day of deliverance from the Congress ministries on 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;December 1939. The result was that anti-congress and pro-Muslim League ministries were formed in a number of provinces which allowed Muslim League to organize itself afresh.</p> <p>I have fond memories of Gorakhpur, because it then included Lar Town and village Manjharia with our courtyard house, and our village with Mango and Lychee orchards. We used to reach it on a bullock cart, as there were no roads and bridges, and therefore bullocks alone could wade through the agricultural fields and various waterborne hazards without being drowned or washed away by strong currents or heavy rainfalls.&nbsp;</p> <p>We spent the long summer months chasing monkeys especially Langoors, climbing trees, running, riding and head bashing with goats and lambs, wrestling, playing&nbsp;<em>kabadi</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>gulli danda</em>&nbsp;with village boys, without any communication with the outside world. Here one of my ancestors had arrived with his nose cut for participating in the 1857 War of Independence against the British. He encountered a Hindu landlord, who offered him the village as a fee for pleading his case against the&nbsp;<em>sarka</em>r for confiscating their&nbsp;<em>riyasat.&nbsp;</em>Therefore our village was also known as&nbsp;<em>nak kate sahib ka gaon</em>&nbsp;and our peasants were Hindus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gorakhpur and the Gorkhas of Nepal derive their name from Saint&nbsp;Gorakhnath (11th century)&nbsp;whose&nbsp;<em>samadhi</em>&nbsp;shrine (tomb) and&nbsp;<em>gaddi</em>&nbsp;(prayer seat) are in Gorakhpur. He is&nbsp;the founder of an order of ascetics called Nath Yogis and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/311271/Kanphata-Yogi">Kanphata (ear-split) yogi</a>s because of the large rings that they wear in their ears.&nbsp;</p> <p>Abdul Quddus Hanafi Ghaznavi Chishti Gangohi (1456-1537), a Sufi poet and leading Chisti shaikh wrote &ldquo;Rushd Nama&rdquo;, a work that sought to reconcile the teachings of Gorakhnath with Chisti Sufism. Gorakhnath&nbsp;is considered immortal and invisible, an eternal sage who had been around for thousands of years watching the welfare of humanity, and the inspiration behind Kabir (poet and saint), Guru Nanak (founder of Sikhism), and Raja Bharatrihari (Sanskrit grammarian and poet).&nbsp;Gorakhnath is mentioned in the songs of all of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Gorakhpur is the town of Kasia, known, variously, in history as Kushawati,&nbsp;Kushinagar,&nbsp;Kusinagar,&nbsp;Kusinara and Kushinara.&nbsp;It was built as capital of the Malla confederacy by Kusha, son of Lord Rama.&nbsp;After Lord Rama&rsquo;s renunciation of the world, Kuhsa left Kushwati for Ayodhya. And his cousin, Chandra Ketu, son of Lakshman, took over this region.</p> <p>H. H. Wilson made the suggestion in 1854 that ancient Kushinagar and Kasia were the same.&nbsp;After excavations the main stupa was exposed in 1876 AD, and a 6.10 meter long golden statue of the reclining Buddha was discovered.&nbsp;It was here that&nbsp;Buddha&nbsp;(the Awakened or the Enlightened)&nbsp;attained&nbsp;<em>mahaparinirvana</em>, or the final deathless state, and abandoned his earthly body, c. 483 BCE.&nbsp;Now, Kushinagar is one of the four major Buddhist pilgrimage destinations. The other three are:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/nepal/lumbini.htm">Lumbini</a>&nbsp;(birthplace of Buddha) in Nepal;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/india/bodhgaya.htm">Bodh Gaya</a>&nbsp;(place of enlightenment) in Mahabodhi Temple, Bihar; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/india/sarnath.htm">Sarnath</a>&nbsp;(first teaching) in U.P.</p> <p>To the Buddhist there is the&nbsp;noble&nbsp;eight-fold&nbsp;path to the&nbsp;cessation of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha"><em>dukkha</em></a>, that includes the virtues of Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.</p> <p>About 15 kilometers, from Kushinagar is&nbsp;Pavapuri, the second capital of the Malla Dynasty, where Lord Buddha's contemporary Lord&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira">Mahavira</a>&nbsp;was born, and took his&nbsp;<em>mahaparinirvana,</em>&nbsp;at his maternal uncle's palace. Lord Mahavira, &lsquo;Great Hero&rsquo; (599&nbsp;&ndash; 527 BC), was&nbsp;the 24th and the last&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>,&nbsp;who established the central&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet">tenets</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>, the oldest religion of India.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jain theology states that Jainism has existed since eternity and it has no beginning and no end. The first Tirthankar, Rushabhdev/Adhinath, appeared prior to the Harappan Civilization. The swastika symbol and naked statues resembling Jain monks, that archaeologists have found among the remains of the Harappan Civilization, tend to support this claim. There are five basic ethical principles (vows) prescribed by Jainism:</p> <p>Non-violence (Ahimsa) - to cause no harm to living beings.</p> <p>Truth (Satya) - to speak the truth always in a harmless manner.</p> <p>Non-stealing (Asteya) - not to take anything that is not willingly given.</p> <p>Celibacy (Brahmacarya)- not to indulge in sensual pleasures.</p> <p>Non-attachment (Aparigraha) - to detach from people, places, and material things.</p> <p>Gorakhpur is the site of Sant Kabir Nagar, where the famous poet-saint Kabir (c.1440-1518) of the Bhakti movement spent his last years after he was banished from Varnasi (Banaras) in 1495. After his banishment he wrote his famous dohas and&nbsp;he has both dargah tomb and samādhi mandir in Gorakhpur to satisfy both his Muslim and his Hindu followers, both groups believing that he belonged to their faith. Kabir himself wrote;</p> <p><em>&lsquo;Jogi call upon Gorakh,&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>Hindus chant the name of Ram</em></p> <p><em>Musalman say one Khuda</em></p> <p><em>Lord of Kabir pervades everything.&rsquo;</em></p> <p>Gorakhpur also contains the house where the great Urdu fiction writer Munshi Premchand (1880-1936) lived and worked from 1916 to 1921, and&nbsp;composed his first literary work. A park is named after him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gorakhpur has the house where the noted Urdu poet, Firaq Gorakhpuri (1896-1982) was born. He was selected for Indian Civil Service but resigned to follow Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s Non-cooperation movement, and went to jail. He later joined Allahabad University as a lecturer in English Literature. He wrote;</p> <p><em>&lsquo;Sakut-e-sham mitao bahut andhera hay</em></p> <p><em>sukhan ke shama jalao bahut andhera hay&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>dayar-e-gham mein dil-e-beqarar chut gaya&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>sambhal ke dhudhane jao bahut andhera hay&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>ye raat wo ke sujhe jahan na hath ko hath&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>khayalo dur na jao bahut andhera hay&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>laton ko chehare pe dale wo so raha hay&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>kaheen zaya-e-rukh ko churao bahut andhera hay&rsquo;</em></p> <p>Also in Gorakhpur is Chauri-Chaura, where on 4 February 1922 volunteers participating in the peaceful non-cooperation movement of Mahatma Gandhi turned violent and burnt down the police station, forcing the Mahatma to call off his movement on 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;February 1922, and go on a five-day fast as penance for lives lost.</p> <p>&nbsp;Gorakhpur is the headquarters of North-Eastern Railway, where the choti and bari (small and broad gauge) railway lines meet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Further more it is the home of the sweet Bhojpuri language which acts as a bridge between the Awadhi and the Bihari tongues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
