section: 4

<p><img alt="Text Box: " width="25" height="74" align="left" hspace="9" />The Heritage Foundation chief, Ms.
    Yasmeen Lari,&nbsp;<em>Sitara-i-Imtiaz, Hillal-i-Imtiaz,</em>was speaking at a seminar in Islamabad about the
    sorry state of heritage in Pakistan where Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany of the Supreme Court was also present.
    Justice Osmany asked Ms. Lari to write to the Supreme Court. Therefore she sent to the Supreme Court a
    statement of State of Heritage (Chapter 8). Unfortunately Justice Osmany retired before the case came up for
    hearing.</p>
<p>On the first hearing, the Supreme Court asked Ms. Yasmeen Lari to give a solution, which she filed on 30<sup>th</sup>December
    2015 (Chapter 9) before the Supreme Court, and which was fixed for hearing on 1<sup>st</sup>January 2016 as
    Human Rights Case No 8730-S/2015. Her solution was;</p>
<p>&lsquo;According to the Mohatta Palace Gallery Trust article 4, a member shall hold office for five years. The
    Mohatta Palace Gallery Trust was created on 14.9.95 with 15 members, including Mr. Abdul Hameed Akhund.
    Although others have retired, Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund remains there after over twenty years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;According to the Terms of Reference of the Managing Trustee article 2.2, a trustee is appointed for a
    period of three years. Mr. Hameed Haroon was notified vide GS/33-21/97 (SO-II) as Managing Trustee of the
    Mohatta Palace Gallery Trust for a period of three years, with effect from 4<sup>th</sup>March 1997 but he
    continues to hold office to this day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Sindh Government established the Sindh Antiquities Endowment Fund with a contribution of Rs. 1,000
    million (one billion rupees), with a board to be appointed for not less than three but not more than five
    years. However Mr. Jahangir Siddiqui and Mr. Hameed Haroon have held their offices since its inception, while
    Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund has been appointed paid secretary without public advertisement.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee under the Sindh Cultural Heritage Preservation Act 1994, was promulgated due to her
    efforts, and almost 600 heritage structures catalogued by her were notified. While she resigned several years
    ago, others have stuck to their offices. Clearly, there is interest in controlling public funds which amount to
    billions of rupees, especially as there is no defined mechanism for monitoring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;If all institutions are working well along with adequate supervisory and monitoring mechanisms, as
    conveyed by their response, why should 3,000 heritage sites be in such poor state, prone to pilferage and
    encroachments, while many of them disappear without a trace. Lack of trained staff is another factor which
    results in mishandling conservation works by public funded institutions.</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p align="center"><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>&lsquo;In the light of the above facts I pray that the Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court may like to direct:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No committee, board member or trustee should be appointed to any organization or institution, which has
    been created by the government with tax payers&rsquo; money, for more than two years and two terms, and those
    who have exceeded it should vacate their offices with immediate effect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All paid employees should be appointed on merit through public advertisement for a fixed term of not more
    than five years. Annual audited balance sheets, annual plans and project reports must be displayed on their
    websites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Lari&rsquo;s petition to the Supreme Court angered those who had acquired billions from public funds in the
    name of heritage, while historic heritage sites are encroached on, pilfered from and destroyed without proper
    inventory, demarcation or boundary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To force Ms. Lari to withdraw her&nbsp;petitionbefore the Supreme Court,&nbsp;Mr. Abdul Hameed Akhund, Secretary
    of the Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of the Heritage of Sindh (EFT) and Trustee of the Mohatta Palace
    Museum,wrote letter No. EFT/Projects/1-/2016 dated 16 February 2016 to the Secretary of Culture, Tourism and
    Antiquities Department, Government of Sindh, stating that &ldquo;the Heritage Foundation has about 2-3 months
    back damaged the outer shell of the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim, Makli WHS, which damage has put the structural
    integrity of the dome at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not aware that the dome of the Sultan Ibrahim was the first double dome to be built in South Asia;
    therefore the workers operating inside between the two domes had to have a passages/holes through which to
    breath and come out, which they covered with tiles. When the Heritage Foundation began work they removed the
    loose tiles for safekeeping, so that they did not fall and break like others, but the passages/holes had
    remained there since its construction five hundred years ago, and had not in any way affected the stability of
    the dome. In fact a number of holes in the outer layer of the tomb can be seen in photographs taken over the
    years and can also be seen in photographs taken at the handing over of the tomb to the Heritage Foundation,
    when the archaeology department including Qasim Ali Qasim was present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr. Qasim Ali
    Qasim, Director of Archaeology &amp; Museums, Culture Department,Government of Sindh, replied on the same day
    with dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous intention to blackmail the Heritage Foundation to Mr. Akhund vide
    letter No 27/3-Dams-Adam/2016 dated 16 February 2016, falsely and dishonestly stating, &ldquo;the Dome of
    Sultan Ibrahim has been damaged by M/s Heritage Foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their target was the
    tomb of Sultan Ibrahim because it was a project funded by the US Ambassador&rsquo;s Fund, which is not in
    favour of corruption, therefore it made no provision for&nbsp;<em>bhatta&nbsp;</em>or largesse, which annoyed
    Mr. Qasim who was a habitual bhatta taker.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Hameed Haroon,&nbsp;Managing Trustee of the Mohatta Palace Museum, Trustee of Endowment Fund
    Trust,&nbsp;CEO of&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>Newspaper began defamation of the Heritage
    Foundation by publishing false,&nbsp;dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous&nbsp;report in&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated
    24<sup>th</sup>February 2016 titled, &ldquo;Historical Sultan Ibrahim tomb damaged during rehabilitation
    work&rdquo;&nbsp;to blackmail Ms. Lari and the Heritage Foundationby quoting Mr. Akhund and Mr. Qasim, and
    reporting that a team would be set up to hold an inquiry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Niaz Ali Abbasi, Secretary of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities Department, on the basis of the aforesaid
    false and fraudulent&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>report, issued on the next day, notification no. SO(G)CIBAD/TOMB/2016
    dated 25 February 2016, constituting an inquiry committee of eight &ldquo;to investigate the alleged damage
    occurred to the tomb of &lsquo;Mir Sultan Ibrahim&rsquo; at Makli during the conservation work undertaken by
    M/s Heritage Foundation Pakistan. And stop work till the report and final decision by the Culture
    Department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&nbsp;Neither Mr. Akhund nor Mr. Qasim nor Mr. Haroon nor Mr. Abbasi are engineers, capable of assessing
    structural damage. Also, they had no access to the tomb while the documentation and conservation work was being
    carried out by the Heritage Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In complete disregard of ethics and the concept of conflict of interest they created&nbsp;an Inquiry Committee
    of functionaries and beneficiaries of Hameed Haroon and Hameed Akhund.Despite their manipulation, only 3 out of
    8 members of their Inquiry Committee signed the report, which was tantamount to a rejection rather than a
    confirmation of the alleged damage. Furthermore, since three signatures appear only on the last page of the
    six-page report, the five pages which carry no numbers or signatures could easily have been changed. This is
    clear from the statement of Architect Shahab Ghani Khan, one of the three signatories, who came with Architect
    Murad to tell Ms. Lari that&nbsp;he had signed the report because the chairman of the inquiry committee, Mr.
    Kamil Khan Mumtaz, had told him that it was against alleged damage and in favour of the Heritage Foundation.
    When Ms. Faryal Gohar interviewed the Chairman of the inquiry committee, Kamil Khan Mumtaz, he told her that he
    did not sign the report and that his signature on the report is electronically generated.</p>
<p>As the Inquiry Committee did not have a structural consultant, therefore Engineer Mr. Mushtaq Dawood was
    appointed to inspect the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim. The Engineer Mushtaq Dawood said that the talk of damaging the
    tomb by the Heritage Foundation was absolute nonsense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also incomplete disregard of ethics and the concept of conflict of interest, the twin Hameeds, Haroon and Akhund
    soul mates, invited the supreme court judges to a Mohatta Palace function organized in memory of a legal
    luminary, which the former had never done before, while our human rights petition against them was pending
    before the Supreme Court, and which to our horror they accepted. This was in conflict with the judicial
    tradition since the British days. And they frightened away a lawyer by saying that they would mutilate, kill
    and bury Lari in Makli.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an open invitation from the Supreme Courtto defame Ms. Lari and the Heritage Foundation with the
    false,&nbsp;dishonest, fraudulent, mischievous&nbsp;reports in&nbsp;<em>Dawn.</em></p>
<p>That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>, dated 17.4.16 published the defamatory report falsely titled, &ldquo;Probe confirms
    damage to 15<sup>th</sup>-century tomb at Makli&rdquo;.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>failed to report that only 3
    out of 8 members of the inquiry committee had signed the report, which amounted to a rejection rather than a
    confirmation of the alleged damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 22.4.16 published the defamatory editorial, &ldquo;Neglect of Heritage&rdquo;,
    which mentioned the visit of UNESCO, which is the protector of World Heritage Sites, but failed to state that
    UNESCO inspected the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim and saw no damage, and asked the Heritage Foundation to do further
    work on the revival of kashi tiles, which&nbsp;have been pilfered regularly from Makli and other Sindh
    monuments.</p>
<p>That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 13.5.16&nbsp;published the defamatory&nbsp;report that the Sindh Culture Department
    has been asked by the officers belonging to the Federal Ministry of Heritage, to remove temporary structures
    built by the Heritage Foundation without mentioning that it was meant for training artisans and for income
    generating activities for the poor, who were otherwise engaged in begging at the Makli necropolis.</p>
<p>That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 27.2.16 made the defamatory statement against the Heritage Foundation that
    &ldquo;An amount of US $ 260,000 has been provided as financial assistance from the US Ambassador&rsquo;s Fund
    for Culture&rdquo;. That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 17.4.16, 21.4.16 and 13.5.16 repeated the defamatory report,
    because the US embassy only reimburses the expenses incurred by the Heritage Foundation. And neither Ms. Lari
    nor any other director of the Heritage Foundation takes any salary, share, profit or dividend.</p>
<p>That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 24.2.16, published the false, dishonest and defamatory report quoting Qasim Ali
    Qasim and Abdul Hamid Akhund, saying that &lsquo;work had been carried out by unskilled labour and unqualified
    professionals&rsquo;. That&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>dated 27.2.16, 21.4.16 and 13.5.16 repeated this
    defamation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
    fact the Heritage Foundation has more experience of construction and conservation work, and Ms. Lari is more
    qualified than all the persons belonging to all her opponents, as is clear from her attached bio data (chapter
    47). That apart from major monuments in Punjab, KPK and Sindh, the Heritage Foundation has helped build over
    forty thousand earthquake resistant houses in over a hundred villages, tested and certified by NED University
    Lab.</p>
<p><em>Dawn</em>continued its attack on the Heritage Foundation and Ms. Yasmeen Lari, S.I., H.I., and I could not
    find a lawyer, who was not squeamish about filing a case against the&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>mafia. Therefore I
    myself sent them a notice (Chapter 41).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation received a typical lawyers reply from their lawyer, Mr. Muneer A Malik. I wrote back
    thus (Chapter 42) to him;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I paid nine thousand for three cases to Mr. Farook Naik in the 1980&rsquo;s. And now I am told that I
    will have to pay him a crore. Lawyers have become mercenary, and law and justice is beyond the reach of
    ordinary hardworking honest people who are being blackmailed by the media mafia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the hero of the lawyers&rsquo; movement you are well aware of your position and responsibility as an
    officer of the court, which is no less than that of a judge, a bureaucrat, a politician, etc. Therefore I ask
    you kindly to listen to me and to give heed to what I have to say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We keep on talking of eradicating corruption, but we allow the newspaper&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>, founded by
    the Father of the Nation and funded and managed by the All India Muslim League in their struggle for Pakistan,
    to be usurped and used as an organ of corruption and blackmail,and to turn the country into a laughing stock
    with the diplomatic community interested in conserving world heritage sites in Pakistan&hellip;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I implore you to give up advocacy of the Haroons and join us to restore&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>to the honest
    and patriotic journalists of Pakistan by handing it over toPakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), to run
    the editorial side of&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>&hellip;. Further, the<em>Dawn</em>media group should be handed over to
    an association of office holders of the All India Muslim League and/or their children to run the press.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is if we care. If we dare. And if we are not the hollow men, the stuffed men filled with straw,
    making this the dead land, the cactus land, turning it into a wasteland, without respect for its heritage and
    history, and allowing the largest Muslim necropolis in the world declared by UNESCO, of which Pakistan is a
    signatory, as the World Heritage Site Makli, to be destroyed.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Yasmeen Lari, S.I., H.I., filed an application on 11<sup>th</sup>March 2016 with the supreme court in Human
    Rights case no. 8730/2015 to restrain respondents from defamatory actions, blackmailing and coercive action
    (Chapter 43). It was returned on 12<sup>th</sup>March 2016 by Mr. Faisal Noor Junejo, Judicial Assistant of the
    supreme court for suffering from five deficiencies, one of them being that it was not bound in a blue cover as
    per the practice of the Court. Thankfully, Mr. Syed Adil Gilani, Advisor to Transparency International
    Pakistan, decided to join the petitioner on 14 March 2016 and his lawyer helped in overcoming all the
    deficiencies and had the application accepted. But it was not fixed for hearing for over fifteen months till 7
    July 2017 during which period the respondents continued their defamatory, blackmailing and coercive action
    without bothering that the case was pending before the supreme court of Pakistan.</p>
<p>On 7<sup>th</sup>July 2017, a bench of the supreme court appeared. Ms. Lari stood alone without a lawyer or
    assistant, while the Media Mafia was in full strength led by Pompous Bloated Fatty Media chief Hameed Haroon
    and his soul mate Akhund with their mercenary lawyers and hangers-on. The new head of the Supreme Court Bench
    looked at them and asked why a heritage case was fixed as human rights case, and disposed it.</p>
<p>I merely thought it was a case of a judge who has no knowledge or pride in the history and heritage of his
    country and has no concern for a citizen being regularly and repeatedly defamed and threatened in utter
    contempt of the supreme court because a senior judge colleague of his had asked her to file a case to save the
    heritage and history of the country.</p>
<p>Syed Adil Gilani who had joined as a petitioner in the case but had been posted abroad as ambassador, could not
    attend the case because of short notice, phoned in the evening to find the status of the case. When he heard
    what had happened, he uttered &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same was the case with every one I met at the club that
    evening. Yet no one dared to join her to oppose the robbers and destroyers of our history and heritage, the
    pompous bloated fatty media mafia chief executive Hameed who had usurped Dawn from his uncle who had filed a
    case against him before he died.</p>
