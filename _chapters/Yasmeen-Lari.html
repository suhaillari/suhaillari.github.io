<p>2020, March, Yasmeen Lari, Pakistan&#39;s first female architect, was awarded the Jane Drew Prize 2020 for raising
    the profile of women in architecture. The Jane Drew Award is part of the Architects&#39; Journal (AJ) and The
    Architectural Review&rsquo;s W awards series, formally known as the Women in Architecture awards.</p>

<p>2020, awarded honorary degree</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation was the first organization that began systematic cataloguing and working on saving historic
    urban structures.</p>

<p>Ms. Lari was the first to start preserving the heritage of Pakistan. The GPO on Mall Road Lahore and Flagstaff House
    in Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act 1994, proposed by Ms. Lari, was unanimously passed by the Sindh
    Assembly. Thereby about 600 buildings documented by her in Karachi were preserved, and a committee was formed to
    implement the law and to document and protect more buildings. But Abdul Hamid Akhund, secretary to the governor and
    culture secretary, and Hameed Haroon got themselves nominated onto the committee, and did their best to defeat the
    act by not implementing its purpose which was to document and save the heritage of the whole of Sindh. Akhund used
    to say that. Lari had got the Heritage Act passed with a gun at his head. By that what he meant was that despite
    being the blue eyed boy of governor Mehmood Haroon and soul mate of Hameed Haroon, he was helpless before the
    support she had of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Chief Minister Abdullah Shah and the opposition leader Bhopali in
    the Sindh Assembly.</p>

<p>Ms. Lari created Karavan Karachi to generate public awareness and support for heritage. Karavan Karachi met every
    Sunday at a heritage building where school bands would start playing in the afternoon to attract people. With
    thousands of people watching, the chief guest would place a plaque on the heritage building, followed by speeches,
    plays, skits, and music shows relating to heritage offered by schools and theatre groups.</p>

<p>She devised the Karavan MeraPakistan programme, to safeguard historic buildings, to foster a duty of care for
    heritage assets, to develop pride and a stake in the city by initiating a sustained process of cleaning and washing
    Karachi&#39;s heritage. This was done by involving school children and by white washing posters from walls and
    replacing them with paintings by students. These functions were held in Karachi from 2001-2004, followed by several
    cities ranging from Bahawalpur Palaces, Darawar Fort and the World Heritage Sites of Lahore&#39;s Shahi Qila and
    Buddhist monuments of Taxila.</p>

<p>When one of the important heritage sites in Pakistan, that is the Shish Mahal of Lahore Fort, was endangered, UNESCO
    appointed Yasmeen Lari National Advisor for conservation and preservation of Lahore Fort.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The documentation of Peshawar city was also taken up in collaboration with UNESCO and a
    publication on Peshawar city was brought out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; UNESCO also appointed her to co-author the Master Plan of Lahore Fort, which identified problem areas
    and worked out strategies for the management of the entire World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>UNESCO devoted a chapter to Yasmeen Lari as one of sixty women from all over the world who had made a significant
    contribution to UNESCO since its inception.</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation has, without any assistance or funding from the government, helped people build, in about two
    hundred villages, over forty thousand earthquake and flood resistant houses, over thirty thousand smokeless chulas
    and hundreds of latrines at almost zero carbon footprint, which is the largest zero carbon intervention in the
    world.</p>

<p>A test at NED College Laboratory was conducted in the presence of the vice-chancellor himself and representatives of
    international agencies, and it was found that the Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s earth, lime and bamboo structures
    could withstand over twice the intensity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan.</p>

<p>Her work was filmed by a prize-winning Indian film maker named Faiza, and broadcast by Aljazera TV in their series on
    rebel architecture. Safeeyah Moosa of South Africa sent a photographer to film her work, which was broadcast on TV
    stations in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Phaidon Press Limited of Regent&rsquo;s Wharf, All Saints Street, London, and 180 Varick Street New York NY
    10014, published an encyclopedia of the 20th Century World Architecture built between 1900 and 1999, in 97 countries
    of the world, comprising every imaginable building type, from the smallest single houses, cafes and zoo structures
    to huge utopian housing projects, centres of government, and new universities. The experts from the building
    industry, chose 757 examples of the most outstanding work done during the twentieth century, from a selection made
    by over 150 specialist advisors from every geographical region of the world. One of the works selected was her house
    in Karachi, designed by Yasmeen Lari.</p>
