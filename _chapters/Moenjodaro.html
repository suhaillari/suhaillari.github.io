<p>Another gentleman whom we had never met, but who arrived at our house to seek my wife&rsquo;s help to build in
    mud was Prof. Dr. Michael R. N. Jansen of RWT University of Aachen in Germany. He arrived one evening with his
    wife and members of his team, who had come to document and review the work done at Moenjodaro and had to live
    there in tents. Those who are quick to offer tents to people affected by various calamities do not know how
    painful it is to live in them, where the temperature soars to its highest point at noon and drops to its lowest
    at midnight. My wife readily agreed, but warned him that he would not get permission to build in mud. This is
    what happened, and their hope of living in comfortable mud houses never materialized. However we became
    friends, and criticized him for not teaching Pakistanis the latest methods and technology in documentation
    developed in Germany, and for taking all the information that they collected to Germany, which in no way
    benefitted Pakistani architects and archaeologists. Michael immediately agreed to take Pakistanis who would be
    willing to work at Moenjodaro with him, and also offered to help us document the old mud architecture of
    Thatta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife, who was giving evening classes at the school of architecture in Karachi selected her brightest students
    to work with the Germans in Moenjodaro; but they could not bear living in tents and working under the sun, and
    vanished from Moenjodaro after a few days. However my son, Mihail, who was a student of Karachi Grammar School,
    worked during his holidays with them in Moenjodaro. My wife also went there to see at first hand the work that
    the Germans were doing, and lived with them in a tent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that Michael came every year to deposit his things at our house for safekeeping on his way back to Germany
    in the summer and came in the winter to collect them on his way to Mohenjo-Daro. Before he came, Michael phoned
    from Aachen to ask if we needed anything from Germany and brought black bread and black coffee for us. We often
    arranged for his team lectures, seminars and dinner receptions in our Garden and one year a German
    parliamentary delegation came to dinner reception in our Garden and awarded a medal to us, which I have yet to
    decipher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our friendship with the German professor ended when I sent an e-mail on 31 October 2013, which said, &ldquo;Dear
    Madam As required by you the email address of Michael is&nbsp;<u>jansen110@hotmail.com</u>and phone number
    is&nbsp;<u>+49.241.8095.073</u>.&nbsp;I have told him that you may be contacting him. Suhail&rdquo;. I followed
    it by another e-mail on 5 November 2013, assuring her that he is no fake,&ldquo;Univ.-Prof. Dr. Michael Jansen
    is UNESCO Senior Expert. &nbsp;He holds Chair for Conservation and Heritage Management at the&nbsp;German
    University of Technology GTECH, Muscat, Oman.&nbsp;And&nbsp;is Director Aachen Conservation and Documentation
    Center (ACDC)&nbsp;at the&nbsp;facultyof architecture - Aachen Universityâ€¨. Suhail&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ihad introduced him to the power elite in the hope that it would lead to some good for heritage. But it ended in
    his never leaving the marble palace and its comforts on his visits to Pakistan. His excuse was that they were
    prisoners as the security situation never allowed them to move out to our house as they regularly did in the
    past such is the magic of money and power to all hungry humans, Europeans or Asians.</p>
<p>The earliest farming settlement, cultivating plants (wheat and barley) and domesticating animals (sheep, goat
    and cattle) have been discovered at Mehrgarh in Baluchistan in Asia, dating from 7000 BCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    earliest evidence of pottery in South Asia is also found there from 5500 BCE. Between 5000 and 4000 BCE,
    farming communities spread into Sindh, Punjab and Northern India. Their inhabitants migrated to the fertile
    valleys of the Indus and Saraswati rivers, and developed a well-organized, and highly&nbsp;advanced
    civilization by 2800 BCE. They were the first to have central urban planning that had well organized wastewater
    drainage systems, trash collection systems, public granaries and baths. They also developed the first accurate
    system of weights and measures. Their economy was based on trade. Therefore most city-dwellers were artisans
    and merchants, as flood deposits gave them a large agricultural surplus. They used bullock carts of the kind
    that are still used in South Asia, and developed boats with sails. They had a massive dredged canal and docking
    facility in the coastal city of Lothal. The Indus civilization contradicts the&nbsp;hydraulic
    despotismhypothesis of the origin of&nbsp;state; asthere is no evidence there of kings, palaces, armies, slaves
    and forced mobilization of labour nor of gods, goddesses, priests and temples.&nbsp;Around 1900 BCE, signs of a
    gradual decline begin to emerge, and by around 1800 BCE, most of the cities were abandoned.&nbsp;The satellite
    photographs have revealed the dry bed of a big river, with the width at some places of six kilometers, from the
    Shivalik Mountains near Simla up to the Ran of Kuchh. In the Vedas, there are references to such a big river
    named Saraswati, to which the rivers Yamuna and Sutlej used to flow. However, the geological changes diverted
    the Sutlej River towards the Indus, and the Jamuna river towards the Ganges, following which the Saraswati
    River no longer had enough water to reach the sea, and dried up in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thar_desert">Thar
        Desert</a>.&nbsp;However, according to the Puranas, Saraswati hid herself out of shame because of the
    indiscretion of a priest and went underground, meeting the Ganges at Triveni Sangam at Allahabad.</p>
<p>The Saraswati River, now dried up, ran parallel to and east of the Indus River. About 96 sites have been
    discovered around the&nbsp;Indus and its tributaries, while about 500 sites have been discovered along the
    dried-up SaraswatiRiver and its tributaries. According to another calculation,&nbsp;nearly 2,000 of the 3,000
    Harrapan sites discovered so far are located outside of the Indus river valley.And&nbsp;more than 70 per cent
    of the sites are located on the banks of what was the Saraswati river. When the&nbsp;Saraswatidried up, the
    civilisation collapsed.Archaeologists now reject the view that the Indus civilization was destroyed by the
    Aryans, preferring to say that they came in after the end of that civilization.However, there are no written
    records before the third century BC except for the Indus Valleyseals, which remain unreadable. And after the
    Aryan invasion or migration, literacy was wiped out, and did not reappear for another 1,000 years, when they
    got scripts from abroad from traders in the south in the shape of Brahmi and conquerors in the north in the
    form of Kharoshti (Khar washti-noise of donkey).</p>
