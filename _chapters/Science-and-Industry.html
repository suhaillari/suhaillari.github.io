<p>Compared to the Mediterranean, Muslim and Chinese civilizations, northwestern Europe in the 16th century was
    considered technically and culturally, backward. They seemed an unlikely candidate for future economic
    leadership of the world. Yet it was there that the changes took place that propelled it into the forefront of
    world development.</p>
<p>Agriculture played a central role.&nbsp;The improved climate from 700 to 1200 in Western Europe led to an
    agricultural revolution andan impressive growth in population, whereby towns and trade grew and created money
    economy.&nbsp;The warrior nobility established a&nbsp;European feudalism that ensured the loyalty of vassals
    and introduced technological changes.&nbsp;There were new farming devices, like the use of the heavy plough,
    widespread use of iron and horses, and crop rotation, and the use of mills for processing cloth, brewing beer,
    crushing pulp for paper manufacture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, Northwestern Europe was the origin and heartland of the Protestant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Reformation">Reformation</a>of
    the 16th century. German&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Max-Weber-German-sociologist">Max
        Weber</a>(1864-1920) suggested that Roman Catholicism and Eastern religions were essentially otherworldly
    religions.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Protestantism">Protestantism</a>,on the other hand,
    was predominantly a this-worldly religion. Protestantism nurtured the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/rationalism">rationalist</a><a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/culture">culture</a>and the scientific habits of mind,and applied
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method">scientific method</a>of observation,
    hypothesis, experimentation, and verification not only to nature but also to society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics">geopolitics</a>of an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">imperialist
        power</a>determined the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism">colonial</a>practices of
    either&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler_colonialism">settler colonialism</a>or of
    exploitative colonialism.&nbsp;The exploitative type of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism">colonialism</a>conquered
    a country to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour">exploit</a>its&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production">natural
        resources</a>and its native population for the immediate financial gain by a colonial government, which
    followed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilism</a>designed to strengthen the
    home economy at the expense of rivals, and trade only with the mother country.</p>
<p>England was engaged during the 16th century in two kind of settlement of Ireland. Thefirst was the "exemplary
    plantation", in which small colonies of English would provide model-farming communities that the Irish could
    emulate. The second was punitive in nature, as it provided for the plantation of English settlers on lands
    confiscated following the suppression of rebellions.</p>
<p>The word "colony" comes from the Latin&nbsp;<em>colonia</em>&mdash;"a place for agriculture". The British
    imperialism often used the concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius"><em>Terra
            nulliu</em>s</a>(Latin from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law">Roman law</a>meaning
    'empty land'). British settlement and colonial rule of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>was
    premised on&nbsp;<em>terra nullius</em>, as its settlers considered it unused by its Aboriginal inhabitants.
    Colonialism implies geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Hence, the Russian,
    Ottoman and Austrian Empires, which did not expand over oceans but through the conquest of neighbouring
    territories, are excluded from colonialism.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a title="Ancient Egypt" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptians</a>,&nbsp;<a

<p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people">Ottomans took</a>over the eastern&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a>and
    closed the overland trade routes by the 14th century. Therefore the Europeans had to find new trade routes.</p>
<p>In 1453, the Turks ended the Byzantine Empire, which&nbsp;resulted in the migration&nbsp;of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine">Byzantine</a>Greek
    scholars to Europe and the&nbsp;rediscovery and&nbsp;revival of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Greek</a>and&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Roman</a>art, literature, philosophy, and science - known
    as the&nbsp;<em>Renaissance&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; or &ldquo;reawakening&rdquo; in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/europe">Europe</a>-
    and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>(1452-1519) and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>(1475-1564)
    became models of the Renaissance man.</p>
<p>Martin Luther started the Reformation on 31 October 1517 when he published his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-Five_Theses"><em>Ninety-Five
            Theses</em></a>.&nbsp;His friend,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder">Lucas
        Cranach the Elder</a>(1472&ndash;1553), the painter, illustrated it for a popular audience. The use
    of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#Metal_movable_type_in_Europe">metal movable type</a>in
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">printing press</a>since 1439 provided the means
    of rapid dissemination. The clergy was made subject to the civil law, and the " Word of God" was preached in
    the churches and taught in the schools in the mother tongue. The separation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England">Church
        of England</a>from Rome under<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII</a>began
    in 1529 and was completed by 1537.</p>
<p>Copernicus (1473-1543) came out with the thesis that earth was not flat but round, and revolved round the Sun.
    This was supported by the planetary observations of Galileo Galilee (1564-1642).</p>
<p>In 1492, the last Muslim kingdom of Granada in Spain surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, who financed
    Italian explorer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>(1451-1506)
    from Genoato explore a western route to Asia. He made four trips across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain in 1492,
    1493, 1498 and 1502. Columbus's first two voyages (1492&ndash;93) reached the Bahamas and Caribbean islands. He
    visited the coast of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela">Venezuela</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central
        America</a>over the course of two more voyages,building colonies across oceans that differentiated
    colonialism from other types of&nbsp;<a title="Expansionism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansionism">expansionism</a>.</p>
<p>As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the
    largest areas, from North to South America. By&nbsp;mining gold and silver in the New World, the European
    trading companies began to change the terms of trade that were then used to barter and other types of
    exchange.&nbsp;This led to a&nbsp;<a title="Commercial Revolution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Revolution">Commercial
        Revolution</a>,which saw reforms in accountancy and banking in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Further, the diets of people in the Old World were transformed.&nbsp;Maize and potato, which were previously
    unknown, became dietary staples. New vegetables, such as tomatoes, peppers and pumpkin appeared. Fruits like,
    avocados, pineapples, guavas and papayas. Sugar-rich plants such as sugar maple. Protein-rich legumes such as
    beans. Nuts and peanuts provided oil and fat. Cocoa led to chocolate, and tobacco was cultivated in Europe for
    the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1496 King&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England">Henry VII of England</a>,
    commissioned&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot">John Cabot</a>to lead a voyage to discover
    a route to Asia via the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">North Atlantic</a>. Cabot
    sailed in 1497, and landed on the coast of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)">Newfoundland</a>,
    mistakenly believing, like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher
        Columbus</a>, that he had reached Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1488, a Portuguese nobleman,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias">Bartolomeu Diaz
        (1450-1500),</a>sailed around Africa by rounding the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope">Cape
        of Good Hope</a>, which he named the Cape of Storms, where he died on 29 May 1500 in a storm.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama">Vasco
        da Gama</a>(1460-1524) made the first voyage from Europe to India and reached Calicut in India on 20 May
    1498.&nbsp;In 1509, the Portuguese&nbsp;under&nbsp;<a title="Francisco de Almeida" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Almeida">Francisco
        de Almeida</a>&nbsp;won the&nbsp;<a title="Battle of Diu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Diu">battle
        of Diu</a>&nbsp;against a joint&nbsp;<a title="Burji dynasty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burji_dynasty">Mamluk</a>&nbsp;and
    Arab fleet sent to expel the Portuguese from the Arabian Sea.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque">Afonso
        de Albuquerque</a>(1453-1515) established forts at strategic sites, which would dominate the trade routes
    and protect Portuguese interests on land. He&nbsp;seized Goa on the coast of India in 1510,&nbsp;which&nbsp;<a
        title="Portugal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">Portugal</a>&nbsp;held until 1961. He
    captured Malacca in 1511, which controlled the narrow strait through which most Far Eastern trade
    moved.&nbsp;In 1557, China decided to lease&nbsp;<a title="Portuguese Macau" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Macau">Macau</a>&nbsp;to
    the Portuguese, which they held until 1999. The Portuguese also became the first Westerners to visit Japan.
    This contact introduced Christianity and firearms into Japan.</p>
<p>Thus&nbsp;Europeans started to carry on trade from forts in Asia, acting as foreign merchants rather than as
    settlers as in Americas that were treated as political extensions of the mother countries.</p>
<p>The first demonstration of Earth's sphericity came from the Portuguese explorer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan">Ferdinand
        Magellan</a>(1480-1521), who departed from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville">Seville</a>with
    five ships on August 10, 1519. He crossed the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic
        Ocean</a>, passed through what is now called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Magellan">Strait
        of Magellan</a>under South America, crossed the Pacific, and arrived in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu">Philippines</a>,
    where he was killed; but his second in command, the Spaniard&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano">Juan
        Sebastian Elcano</a>,continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the
    circumnavigation of the world.&nbsp;In 1565, cargoes of Chinese goods were transported from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a title="Philippines"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</a>to&nbsp;<a title="Mexico" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a>&nbsp;and

        War</a>inflamed religious tensions and turned Southeast Asia into an arena of conflict between Muslims and
    Christians.Portuguese decline in Asia was due to attacks on their commercial empire by the Dutch and the
    English, which lasted until the end of the&nbsp;<a title="Seven Years' War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War">Seven
        Years' War</a>&nbsp;in 1763.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Company">Virginia Company</a>founded England's first

    The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Carolina">Province of Carolina</a>was founded in
    1663.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1655, England annexed the island of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</a>from the
    Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas">Bahamas</a>.The&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean">Caribbean</a>provided England with lucrative colonies, where
    it adopted the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation">sugar plantations</a>system used by the
    Portuguese in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Brazil">Brazil</a>, based on slave labour.</p>
<p>With the surrender of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Amsterdam">Fort Amsterdam</a>, England
    gained control of the Dutch colony of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland">New
        Netherland</a>in 1664, renaming it New York. In 1681, the colony of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>was
    founded by the Oxford educated Quaker missionary and writer,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Penn">William
        Penn</a>of&nbsp;<em>No Cross NO Crown</em>.The American colonies were less financially successful than
    those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land, which attracted far larger numbers of
    English emigrants, who preferred its temperate climate.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_African_Company">Royal African Company</a>was founded in
    1660 in London, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies.
    Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas - a third of
    all&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade">slaves transported across the Atlantic</a>.In
    the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80%
    in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern
    colonies), The slave trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for&nbsp;western<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom">British
        cities</a>such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company">English East India Company</a>was
    founded on 31 December 1600, which competed with Portugal and the Netherlands for trade and colonial power. It
    acquired&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras">Madras</a>in 1639 and quickly surpassed Portuguese
    Goa as the principal European trading centre on the Indian Subcontinent. The hostilities with the Netherlands
    ceased after the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>of
    1688, when the Dutch&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England">William of Orange</a>ascended
    the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the
    spice trade of the East Indies to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles
    soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the
    Dutch by 1720.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War">Seven Years' War</a>(1756&ndash;1763)
    involving France, Britain and the other major European powers, ended in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)">Treaty
        of Paris (1763)</a>. France accepted British claims to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land">Rupert's

    and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_France)">Louisiana</a>to Spain. Spain ceded
    Florida to Britain. The Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power. It
    alsomarked the end of the French stake in India.</p>
<p>The great Mughal Empire crumbled after the death of Aurangzeb (1618-1707), though the Mughals kept the imperial

    America declared independence for the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">United

    the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the favour of Americans and American independence was
    acknowledged at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Paris_(1783)">Peace of Paris</a>in
    1783.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1718,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_transportation">transportation</a>to the American
    colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts
    transported per year across the Atlantic.After the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British

    establishment of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony">penal settlement</a>, and in 1787
    the first shipment of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convicts_in_Australia">convicts</a>set sail,
    arriving in 1788. Britain continued to transport convicts to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">New
        South Wales</a>until 1840. The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold, mainly
    because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria, making its capital&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne">Melbourne</a>for
    a time the richest city in the world and the second largest city (after&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>)

<p>During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first discovered by Dutch explorer&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman">Abel

<p>Britain was challenged again by France under&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon">Napoleon</a>,
    who threatened to invade Britain itself. French ports were blockaded by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal

    the Netherlands, and gained control of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Ceylon</a>(1795&ndash;1815).</p>
<p>The Scottish economist, philosopher and author,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith">Adam
        Smith</a>(1723-1790) published&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations"><em>Wealth
            of Nations</em></a>in 1776, which argued that Britain should grant independence to its colonies as it
    would be economically beneficial for British people, and that&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade">free
        trade</a>should replace the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilist</a>policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of trade between the newly independent&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United
        States</a>and Britain after 1783 confirmed Smith's view that political control was not necessary for
    economic success.About 350,000 people had emigrated from England across the Atlantic by the end of the 17th
    century. And by 1798, North America and the West Indies received 57 per cent of British exports, and supplied
    32 per cent of imports.</p>
<p>Britain acquired economic momentum from the pursuit of science and industry.&nbsp;The share of men employed in
    agriculture fell from 60 percent to about 25 percent, while the share of those employed in industry rose from
    less than 20 percent to nearly 50 percent. Between 1700 and 1850, England&rsquo;s population surged from
    between 6 and 7 million to nearly 21 million. Industrial output, which had increased by less than 1 percent per
    year in the first half of the 18th century, was rising by nearly 3 percent per year by the early part of the
    19th century.&nbsp;By 1901, the year of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s death, the census recorded three quarters of the
    population as urban (two thirds in cities of 10,000 or more and half in cities of 20,000 or more). In the
    span&nbsp;of a century a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/rural-society">rural society</a>had
    become an urban one.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history. In the two centuries following 1800, the
    world's average per capita income increased over tenfold, while the world's population increased over six fold.
    For the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo
    sustained growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-United-Kingdom">Great
        Britain</a>established the economic
    pattern of the modern world, wherebywork is increasingly done by machines rather than by hand; human and animal
    power are replaced by inanimate sources of energy, such as coal and oil; the creation of a free market in&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/labor-in-economics">labour</a>by the freeing of the labourer from
    feudal and customary ties and obligations, and the concentration of workers in single, comprehensive
    enterprises, the&nbsp;factory; and a pivotal role for a specific social type, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/entrepreneur-business">entrepreneur</a>.</p>
<p>Protestant individualism and the scientific revolution were preconditions of industrialism.I<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/individualism">ndividualism</a>and
    secularism alsoprovoked political revolutions in America and France.&nbsp;However, many new colonies were
    established, including&nbsp;the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire">German</a>and&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_colonial_empire">Belgian colonial empire</a>s. And in the late
    19th century, the European powers&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa">scrambled
        for control of Africa</a>, beginning with the French occupation of Algeria. By the beginning of the 20th
    century, France had created an empire in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochina">Indochina</a>nearly
    50 percent larger than the mother country.</p>
<p>The Europeans had discovered&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_slavery">African slavery</a>by
    Arabs as a means of creating an inexpensive labour force for the colonies.&nbsp;In the early modern period, 10
    to 12 million Africans were taken in this way to the New World, from where colonial produce was transported to
    Europe.With the advent of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial
        Revolution</a>, goods produced by slavery became less important to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_economy">British
        economy</a>. The British&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">Parliament</a>enacted
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_1807">Slave Trade Act</a>in 1807, which
    abolished the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery">slave trade</a>in the
    empire.The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833">Slavery Abolition Act</a>,
    abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834.</p>
<p>The labour shortage that resulted inspired European colonizers to develop a new source of labour.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servant">Indentured
        servants</a>consented to a contract with the European colonizers. Under their contract, the servant would
    work for an employer for a term of at least a year on a wage, while the employer agreed to pay for the
    servant's voyage to the colony and for the return to the country of origin. India and China were the largest
    source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured
    servants were taken from India to the colonies, and 24 million returned to India. China sent more indentured
    servants and around the same proportion returned to China.</p>
<p>By 1914, millions of Europeans also migrated to the colonies. British people were the most numerous migrating to
    the colonies: 2.5 million settled in Canada; 1.5 million in Australia; 750,000 in New Zealand; 450,000 in the
    Union of South Africa; and 200,000 in India. French citizens also migrated in large numbers, mainly to the
    colonies in the north African&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb">Maghreb</a>region: 1.3
    million settled in Algeria; 200,000 in Morocco; 100,000 in Tunisia; while only 20,000 migrated to French
    Indochina. Dutch and German colonies saw relatively scarce European migration, since Dutch and German colonial
    expansion focused on commercial goals rather than settlement. Portugal sent 150,000 settlers to Angola, 80,000
    to Mozambique, and 20,000 to Goa. During the time of the Spanish Empire, approximately 550,000 Spanish settlers
    migrated to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a>.</p>
<p>The world's colonial population at the time of the First World War totaled about 560 million people, of whom
    70.0% were in British domains, 10.0% in French, 8.6% in Dutch, 3.9% in Japanese, 2.2% in German, 2.1% in
    American, 1.6% in Portuguese, 1.2% in Belgian and 1/2 of 1% in Italian possessions. The home domains of the
    colonial powers had a total population of about 370 million people.</p>
<p>The period between 1815 and 1914 is referred to as Britain's "imperial century", as&nbsp;around 10,000,000
    square miles (26,000,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the
    British Empire.Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game">Russia
        in Central Asia</a>. Unchallenged at sea,
    Britain adopted the role of global policeman, known as the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Britannica"><em>Pax
            Britannica</em></a>. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant
    position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as
    China,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina">Argentina</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand">Siam</a>,
    which has been described by some historians as an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_Empire">Informal

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India</a>Company's army had first
    joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War. The two continued to co-operate in the eviction
    of the French from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</a>(1799), the capture of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a>from
    the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>(1819)
    and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca">Malacca</a>(1824)
    and in the defeat of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_rule_in_Burma">Burma</a>(1826).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India</a>Company had also been engaged
    in an increasingly profitable&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a>export trade to China
    since the 1730s. This helped reverse the trade imbalancesresulting from the British imports of tea, which saw
    large outflows of&nbsp;silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities
    at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Canton</a>of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to
    attack China in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a>, and to
    seize<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island">Hong Kong Island</a>.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, Britain and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire">Russian
        Empire</a>vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman,
        Persian and Chinese Empire</a>. This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game">Great
        Game</a>" and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India. When Russia invaded the
    Turkish&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans">Balkans</a>in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a>and Middle East led Britain
    and France to invade the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Peninsula">Crimea</a>to destroy
    Russian naval capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dutch East India Company had founded the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Colony">Cape
        Colony</a>on thesouthern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its
    colonies in&nbsp;the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indies">East Indies</a>. Britain formally acquired
    the colony, and its large&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a>(or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer">Boer</a>)
    population in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands. British immigration pushed thousands of Boers,
    resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own independent republics.</p>
<p>In 1869 the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal">Suez Canal</a>opened under&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon

    control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference">Berlin Conference</a>of 1884&ndash;85 was
    held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa">Scramble
        for Africa</a>" by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of
    territorial claims.<sup>[128]</sup>The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its
    decision in 1885 to withdraw from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan">Sudan</a>. A joint force
    of British and Egyptian troops defeated the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdist_War">Mahdi&rsquo;s

    and 13 million new subjects.</p>
<p>The colonies of Germany and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>were

<p>The colonies were a major cause of&nbsp;<a title="World War II" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World
        War II</a>.The war in the Pacific was caused by Japan's efforts to create a colonial empire in place of the
    existing empires held by the British, French, Dutch and the United States. The war in Europe and North Africa
    was caused partially by Germany and Italy's efforts to create colonial empires that sought to conquer existing
    British, French and Russian colonial empires in these areas</p>
<p>Although the British Empire emerged victorious from the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War">Second
        World War</a>, but Europe that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and overrun
    over by the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain
    was left bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan">a
        $US 4.33&nbsp;billion loan</a>from the United States, the last installment of which was repaid in
    2006.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore&nbsp;<a title="Decolonization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization">decolonization</a>&nbsp;progressed
    rapidly after World War II. Firstlytheimage of the European was shattered by the Japanese occupation of
    British, French and Dutch territories in the East during the Second World War.&nbsp;Second, many colonial
    powers were significantly weakened by World War II.It led to the growth of independence movements in the
    colonies.&nbsp;Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies in contrast to other
    European powers such as France and Portugal, who waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their
    empires intact.</p>
<p>The first wave of European expansion involved exploring the world to find new revenue and perpetuating
    European&nbsp;<a title="Feudalism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism">feudalism</a>.The Spanish and
    Portuguese launched the colonisation of the&nbsp;<a title="Americas" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas">Americas</a>.
    Britain, France and the Netherlands followed them into Caribbean and North America.</p>
<p>The second wave focused on developing the&nbsp;<a title="Mercantilism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantile</a>&nbsp;capitalism
    system and the manufacturing industry in Europe, which&nbsp;commenced with Britain's involvement in Asia
    followed by France, Portugal and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The last wave of European colonialism solidified capitalism by providing new markets and raw
    materials,&nbsp;regulated by the terms of the&nbsp;<a title="Berlin Conference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference">Berlin
        Conference</a>&nbsp;of 1884&ndash;1885,&nbsp;whereby vast regions of Africa came under the sway of Britain,

<p>The USA assumed Britain's role as the "global hegemon" in the 20th century,&nbsp;and continue globalization as

<p>The industrialization changed western society.&nbsp;In preindustrial or nonindustrial society the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/family-kinship">family</a>is
    the basic unit of production. In a typical example from early 18th-century&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/England">England</a>,
    the man might be a weaver and his wife a spinner, with the younger children acting as assistants in the joint
    domestic enterprise. Industrialization moved<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/production">production</a>away
    from the household to the factory, and the family was reduced to a unit of consumption. The small&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/nuclear-family">nuclear
        family</a>faced the impersonal, large-scale, bureaucratic world of work, adolescent alienation and teenage
    rebellion.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/divorce">Divorce</a>rates soared. And one-parent
    families, headed by a woman, came into existence.</p>
<p>Tocqueville had warned that individuals lacking strong intermediate institutions might look to the protection of
    strong men and strong governments. The rise and success of totalitarian movements in some industrial societies
    showed that the tendencies were real and were present in some degree in all-modern societies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution">American</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution">French</a>revolutions
    had brought about a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/constitutionalism">constitutional</a>and&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy">democratic</a>society, whereby no&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-system">political
        system</a>could claim legitimacy that was not in some sensebased on the will of the people,
    constitutionally expressed.&nbsp;Unfortunately the new democratic legitimation was also claimed by popular or
    constitutional dictatorships such as those of Napoleon III in France or Adolf Hitler in
    Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karl&nbsp;Marx was convinced that capitalism would throw up two main economic classes, the property less
    workers, or proletariat, and the capitalist or bourgeoisie owners, which would result in victory for the
