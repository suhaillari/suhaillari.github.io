<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people">Ottomans took</a> over the eastern <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a> and closed the overland trade routes by
    the 14th century. Therefore the Europeans had to find new trade routes.</p>

<p>In 1453, the Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire, which resulted in the migration of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine">Byzantine</a> Greek scholars to Europe and the rediscovery and
    revival of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Greek</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Roman</a> art, literature, philosophy, and science - known as
    the <em>Renaissance </em>&ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; or &ldquo;reawakening&rdquo; in <a
        href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/europe">Europe</a> - and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (1452-1519) and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> (1475-1564) became models of the Renaissance
    man.</p>

<p>Martin Luther started the Reformation on 31 October 1517 when he published his <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-Five_Theses"><em>Ninety-Five Theses</em></a>. His friend, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> (1472&ndash;1553), the
    painter, illustrated it for a popular audience. The use of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#Metal_movable_type_in_Europe">metal movable type</a> in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">printing press</a> since 1439 provided the means of rapid
    dissemination. The clergy was made subject to the civil law, and the &quot; Word of God&quot; was preached in the
    churches and taught in the schools in the mother tongue. The separation of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England">Church of England</a> from Rome under <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII</a> began in 1529 and was completed by
    1537.</p>

<p>Copernicus (1473-1543) came out with the thesis that earth was not flat but round, and revolved round the Sun. This
    was supported by the planetary observations of Galileo Galilee (1564-1642).</p>

<p>In 1492, the last Muslim kingdom of Granada in Spain surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, who financed
    Italian explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> (1451-1506)
    from Genoa to explore a western route to Asia. He made four trips across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain in 1492,
    1493, 1498 and 1502. Columbus&#39;s first two voyages (1492&ndash;93) reached the Bahamas and Caribbean islands. He
    visited the coast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central America</a> over the course of two more voyages,
    building colonies across oceans.</p>

<p>As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus&#39;s voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the
    largest areas, from North to South America. By mining gold and silver in the New World, the European trading
    companies began to change the terms of trade that were then used to barter and other types of exchange. This led to
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Revolution">Commercial Revolution</a>, which saw reforms in
    accountancy and banking in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Further, the diets of people in the Old World were transformed. Maize and potato, which were previously unknown,
    became dietary staples. New vegetables, such as tomatoes, peppers and pumpkin appeared. Fruits like, avocados,
    pineapples, guavas and papayas. Sugar-rich plants such as sugar maple. Protein-rich legumes such as beans. Nuts and
    peanuts provided oil and fat. Cocoa led to chocolate, and tobacco was cultivated in Europe for the first time.</p>

<p>In 1496 King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England">Henry VII of England</a>, commissioned <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot">John Cabot</a> to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">North Atlantic</a>. Cabot sailed in 1497, and landed on
    the coast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)">Newfoundland</a>, mistakenly believing,
    like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, that he had reached
    Asia.</p>

<p>In 1488, a Portuguese nobleman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias">Bartolomeu Diaz
        (1450-1500),</a> sailed around Africa by rounding the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>, which he named the Cape of Storms,
    where he died on 29 May 1500 in a storm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama">Vasco da Gama</a>
    (1460-1524) made the first voyage from Europe to India and reached Calicut in India on 20 May 1498. In 1509, the
    Portuguese under&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Almeida">Francisco de Almeida</a>&nbsp;won
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Diu">battle of Diu</a>&nbsp;against a joint&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burji_dynasty">Mamluk</a>&nbsp;and Arab fleet sent to expel the Portuguese
    from the Arabian Sea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque">Afonso de Albuquerque</a>
    (1453-1515) established forts at strategic sites, which would dominate the trade routes and protect Portuguese
    interests on land. He seized Goa on the coast of India in 1510, which&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">Portugal</a>&nbsp;held until 1961. He captured Malacca in 1511,
    which controlled the narrow strait through which most Far Eastern trade moved.&nbsp;In 1557, China decided to
    lease&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Macau">Macau</a>&nbsp;to the Portuguese, which they
    held until 1999. The Portuguese also became the first Westerners to visit Japan. This contact introduced
    Christianity and firearms into Japan.</p>

<p>Thus Europeans started to carry on trade from forts in Asia, acting as foreign merchants rather than as settlers as
    in Americas that were treated as political extensions of the mother countries.</p>

<p>The first demonstration of Earth&#39;s sphericity came from the Portuguese explorer <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> (1480-1521), who departed from <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville">Seville</a> with five ships on August 10, 1519. He crossed the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, passed through what is now called the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Magellan">Strait of Magellan</a> under South America, crossed the
    Pacific, and arrived in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu">Philippines</a>, where he was killed; but
    his second in command, the Spaniard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano">Juan
        Sebastian Elcano</a>, continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the
    circumnavigation of the world. In 1565, cargoes of Chinese goods were transported from the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</a> to&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a>&nbsp;and from there to&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>. Spanish officials converted the islands to Christianity.
</p>

<p>Compared to the Mediterranean, Muslim and Chinese civilizations, northwestern Europe in the 16th century was
    considered technically and culturally backward. They seemed an unlikely candidate for future economic leadership of
    the world. Yet it was there that the changes took place that propelled it into the forefront of world development.
</p>

<p>Agriculture played a central role. The improved climate from 700 to 1200 in Western Europe led to an agricultural
    revolution and an impressive growth in population, whereby towns and trade grew and created money economy. The
    nobility established a European feudalism that ensured the loyalty of vassals and introduced technological changes.
    There were new farming devices, like the use of the heavy plough, widespread use of iron and horses, and crop
    rotation, and the use of mills for processing cloth, brewing beer, crushing pulp for paper manufacture.</p>

<p>The Northwestern Europe was also the origin and heartland of the Protestant <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Reformation">Reformation </a>of the 16th century. Protestantism nurtured
    the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/rationalism">rationalist </a><a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/culture">culture</a> and the scientific habits of mind,<strong>
    </strong>and applied the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method">scientific method</a> of
    observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and verification not only to nature but also to society.</p>

<p>The exploitative type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism">colonialism</a> conquered a country to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour">exploit</a> its <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production">natural resources</a> and its native population for
    the immediate financial gain by a colonial government, which followed <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilism</a> designed to strengthen the home economy at
    the expense of rivals, and trade only with the mother country.</p>

<p>England was engaged during the 16th century in two kind of settlement of Ireland. The first was the &quot;exemplary
    plantation&quot;, in which small colonies of English would provide model-farming communities that the Irish could
    emulate. The second was punitive in nature, as it provided for the plantation of English settlers on lands
    confiscated following the suppression of rebellions.</p>

<p>The word &quot;colony&quot; comes from the Latin <em>colonia</em>&mdash;&quot;a place for agriculture&quot;. The
    British imperialism often used the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius"><em>Terra
            nulliu</em>s</a> (Latin from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law">Roman law</a> meaning
    &#39;empty land&#39;). British settlement and colonial rule of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a> was premised on <em>terra nullius</em>, as its
    settlers considered it unused by its Aboriginal inhabitants. Colonialism implies geographic separation between the
    colony and the imperial power. Hence, the Russian, Ottoman and Austrian Empires, which did not expand over oceans
    but through the conquest of neighbouring territories, are excluded from colonialism. The&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptians</a>,&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia">Phoenicians</a>,&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Greeks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Romans</a>, all built&nbsp;<a

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Company">Virginia Company</a> founded England&#39;s first permanent
    settlement in the Americas at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia">Jamestown</a> in 1607. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda">Bermuda</a> was settled and claimed by England in 1609. Fleeing
    from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution">religious persecution</a> was the motive of many
    English would-be colonists: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Colony">Plymouth</a>, for example was
    founded as a haven for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan">Puritan</a> religious separatists in 1620. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Maryland">Maryland</a> was founded as a haven for <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Roman Catholics</a>&nbsp;in 1634. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Rhode_Island_and_Providence_Plantations">Rhode Island</a>&nbsp;was
    founded in 1636 as a colony tolerant of all religions, and Connecticut&nbsp;in 1639 for <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church">Congregationalists</a>. The <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Carolina">Province of Carolina</a> was founded in 1663.</p>

<p>In 1655, England annexed the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</a> from the Spanish,
    and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. The <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean">Caribbean</a> provided England with lucrative colonies, where it
    adopted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation">sugar plantations</a> system used by the Portuguese
    in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Brazil">Brazil</a>, based on slave labour.</p>

<p>With the surrender of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Amsterdam">Fort Amsterdam</a>, England gained
    control of the Dutch colony of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland">New Netherland</a> in 1664,
    renaming it New York. In 1681, the colony of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> was founded by the Oxford
    educated Quaker missionary and writer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Penn">William Penn</a> of
    <em>No Cross NO Crown</em>. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but
    had large areas of good agricultural land, which attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants, who preferred
    its temperate climate.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_African_Company">Royal African Company</a> was founded in 1660 in
    London, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies. Britain was
    responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas - a third of all <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade">slaves transported across the Atlantic</a>. In the
    British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780,
    and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies), The slave
    trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for western <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom">British cities</a> such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company">English East India Company</a> founded on 31
    December 1600, acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras">Madras</a> in 1639 and quickly surpassed
    Portuguese Goa as the principal European trading centre on the Indian Subcontinent. When the Dutch <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England">William of Orange</a> ascended the English throne, a
    deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of
    India to England..</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War">Seven Years&#39; War</a> (1756&ndash;1763) involving
    France, Britain and the other major European powers, ended in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)">Treaty of Paris (1763)</a>. It marked the end of the
    French stake in India. France also accepted British claims to <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land">Rupert&#39;s Land</a>, and ceded <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France">New France</a> to Britain and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_France)">Louisiana</a> to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to
    Britain. The Seven Years&#39; War therefore left Britain as the world&#39;s most powerful maritime power.</p>

<p>The great Mughal Empire crumbled after the death of Aurangzeb (1618-1707), though the Mughals kept the imperial title
    until 1858. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Clive">Robert Clive</a> of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company">English East India</a> Company in India,
    defeated the ruler of Bengal at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey">Battle of Plassey</a>
    (1757). And the Company acquired the administration of Bengal from the Mughal Emperor <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Alam_II">Shah Alam II</a> after the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Buxar">Battle of Buxar</a> in 1764.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;American and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_wars_of_independence">Latin
        American wars of independence</a> reduced the spread of colonial empires in the late 18th and early 19th
    centuries. Since 1718, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_transportation">transportation</a> to the
    American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts
    transported per year across the Atlantic.&nbsp; After the loss of the thirteen American Colonies in 1783, the
    British government turned to the newly discovered Australia as an alternative location for convicts.</p>

<p>In 1770 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook">James Cook</a> on a scientific <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_voyage_of_James_Cook">voyage</a> to the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>, claimed the continent of Australia
    for Britain, and named it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">New South Wales</a>. In 1778, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks">Joseph Banks</a>, Cook&#39;s <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany">botanist</a> on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on
    the suitability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany_Bay">Botany Bay</a> for the establishment of a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony">penal settlement</a>, and in 1787 the first shipment of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convicts_in_Australia">convicts</a> set sail, arriving in 1788. Britain
    continued to transport convicts to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">New South Wales</a> until
    1840. The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold, mainly because of gold rushes in the
    colony of Victoria, making its capital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne">Melbourne</a> for a time
    the richest city in the world and the second largest city (after <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>) in the British Empire.</p>

<p>During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first discovered by Dutch explorer <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> in 1642, and claimed the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island">North</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island">South</a> islands for the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom">British crown</a> in 1769 and 1770
    respectively. On 6 February 1840, Captain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hobson">William Hobson</a>
    and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi">Treaty of
        Waitangi</a>, which is considered by many to be New Zealand&#39;s founding document.</p>

<p>Britain was challenged again by France under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, who
    threatened to invade Britain itself. French ports were blockaded by the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a>, which won against a Franco-Spanish fleet at <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar">Trafalgar</a> in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked
    and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated
    by a coalition of European armies in 1815. France ceded the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_the_Ionian_Islands">Ionian Islands</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta_Protectorate">Malta</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia">Saint Lucia</a>, and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago">Tobago</a>; Spain ceded <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad">Trinidad</a>; the Netherlands <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Guiana">Guyana</a>, and the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Colony">Cape Colony</a>. Britain returned <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, Martinique, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana">French Guiana</a>, and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union">R&eacute;union</a> to France, and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname">Suriname</a> to the Netherlands, and gained control of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Ceylon</a> (1795&ndash;1815).</p>

<p>The Scottish economist, philosopher and author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith">Adam Smith</a>
    (1723-1790) published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations"><em>Wealth of Nations</em></a>
    in 1776, which argued that Britain should grant independence to its colonies as it would be economically beneficial
    for British people, and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade">free trade</a> should replace the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilist</a> policies.</p>

<p>The growth of trade between the newly independent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United
        States</a> and Britain after 1783 confirmed Smith&#39;s view that political control was not necessary for
    economic success. About 350,000 people had emigrated from England across the Atlantic by the end of the 17th
    century. And by 1798, North America and the West Indies received 57 per cent of British exports, and supplied 32 per
    cent of imports.</p>

<p>Britain acquired economic momentum from the pursuit of science and industry. The share of men employed in agriculture
    fell from 60 percent to about 25 percent, while the share of those employed in industry rose from less than 20
    percent to nearly 50 percent. Between 1700 and 1850, England&rsquo;s population surged from between 6 and 7 million
    to nearly 21 million. Industrial output, which had increased by less than 1 percent per year in the first half of
    the 18th century, was rising by nearly 3 percent per year by the early part of the 19th century. By 1901, the year
    of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s death, the census recorded three quarters of the population as urban. In the span of a
    century a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/rural-society">rural society</a> had become an urban one.</p>

<p>The Industrial Revolution was a major turning point in history. In the two centuries following 1800, the world&#39;s
    average per capita income increased over tenfold, while the world&#39;s population increased over six fold. For the
    first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth.
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-United-Kingdom">Great Britain</a> established the economic
    pattern of the modern world, whereby<strong> </strong>work is increasingly done by machines rather than by hand;
    human and animal power are replaced by inanimate sources of energy, such as coal and oil; the creation of a free
    market in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/labor-in-economics">labour</a> by the freeing of the labourer
    from feudal and customary ties and obligations, and the concentration of workers in single, comprehensive
    enterprises, the factory; and a pivotal role for a specific social type, the <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/entrepreneur-business">entrepreneur</a>.</p>

<p>Protestant individualism and the scientific revolution were preconditions of industrialism. I<a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/individualism">ndividualism</a> and secularism also provoked political
    revolutions in America and France. However, many new colonies were established, including the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire">German</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_colonial_empire">Belgian colonial empire</a>s. And in the late 19th
    century, the European powers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa">scrambled for control of
        Africa</a>, beginning with the French occupation of Algeria. By the beginning of the 20th century, France had
    created an empire in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochina">Indochina</a> nearly 50 percent larger than
    the mother country.</p>

<p>The Europeans had discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_slavery">African slavery</a> by Arabs as
    a means of creating an inexpensive labour force for the colonies. In the early modern period, 10 to 12 million
    Africans were taken in this way to the New World, from where colonial produce was transported to Europe. With the
    advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, goods
    produced by slavery became less important to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_economy">British
        economy</a>. The British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">Parliament</a>
    enacted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_1807">Slave Trade Act</a> in 1807, which
    abolished the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery">slave trade</a> in the empire.<strong>
    </strong>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833">Slavery Abolition Act</a>, abolished
    slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834.</p>

<p>The labour shortage that resulted inspired European colonizers to develop a new source of labour. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servant">Indentured servants</a> consented to a contract with the
    European colonizers. Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year on a
    wage, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant&#39;s voyage to the colony and for the return to the country
    of origin. India and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Between 1830 and
    1930, around 30 million indentured servants were taken from India to the colonies, and 24 million returned to India.
    China sent more indentured servants and around the same proportion returned to China.</p>

<p>By 1914, millions of Europeans also migrated to the colonies. British people were the most numerous migrating to the
    colonies: 2.5 million settled in Canada; 1.5 million in Australia; 750,000 in New Zealand; 450,000 in the Union of
    South Africa; and 200,000 in India. French citizens also migrated in large numbers, mainly to the colonies in the
    north African <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb">Maghreb</a> region: 1.3 million settled in Algeria;
    200,000 in Morocco; 100,000 in Tunisia; while only 20,000 migrated to French Indochina. Dutch and German colonies
    saw relatively scarce European migration, since Dutch and German colonial expansion focused on commercial goals
    rather than settlement. Portugal sent 150,000 settlers to Angola, 80,000 to Mozambique, and 20,000 to Goa. During
    the time of the Spanish Empire, approximately 550,000 Spanish settlers migrated to <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a>.</p>

<p>The world&#39;s colonial population at the time of the First World War totaled about 560 million people, of whom
    70.0% were in British domains, 10.0% in French, 8.6% in Dutch, 3.9% in Japanese, 2.2% in German, 2.1% in American,
    1.6% in Portuguese, 1.2% in Belgian and 1/2 of 1% in Italian possessions. The home domains of the colonial powers
    had a total population of about 370 million people.</p>

<p>The period between 1815 and 1914 is referred to as Britain&#39;s &quot;imperial century&quot;, as around 10,000,000
    square miles (26,000,000&nbsp;km2) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire.
    Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game">Russia in Central Asia</a>. Unchallenged at sea, Britain
    adopted the role of global policeman, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Britannica"><em>Pax
            Britannica</em></a>. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain&#39;s dominant
    position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand">Siam</a>, which has been described by some historians as an
    &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_Empire">Informal Empire</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat">steamship</a> and the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy">telegraph</a>, new technologies invented in the second half of
    the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a
    network of telegraph cables, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Red_Line">All Red Line</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India</a> Company&#39;s army had first joined
    forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years&#39; War. The two continued to co-operate in the eviction of the
    French from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</a> (1799), the capture of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a> from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> (1819) and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca">Malacca</a> (1824) and in the defeat of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_rule_in_Burma">Burma</a> (1826).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India</a> Company had also been engaged in an
    increasingly profitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a> export trade to China since the
    1730s. This helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows
    of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Canton</a> of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China
    in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a>, and to seize <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island">Hong Kong Island</a>.</p>

<p>During the 19th century, Britain and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire">Russian Empire</a>
    vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman, Persian and Chinese Empire</a>. This rivalry in
    Central Asia came to be known as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game">Great
        Game</a>&quot; and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India. When Russia invaded the Turkish <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans">Balkans</a> in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a> and Middle East led Britain and France
    to invade the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Peninsula">Crimea</a> to destroy Russian naval
    capabilities.</p>

<p>The Dutch East India Company had founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Colony">Cape Colony</a> on
    the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indies">East Indies</a>. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> (or <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer">Boer</a>) population in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands.
    British immigration pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own independent
    republics.</p>

<p>In 1869 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal">Suez Canal</a> opened under <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon III</a>, linking the Mediterranean with the
    Indian Ocean. In 1875, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)">Conservative</a>
    government of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> bought the indebted
    Egyptian ruler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha">Isma&#39;il Pasha&#39;s</a> 44% shareholding
    in the Suez Canal for &pound;4 million (&pound;340&nbsp;million in 2013). The Joint Anglo-French financial control
    over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference">Berlin Conference</a> of 1884&ndash;85 was held to
    regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the &quot;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa">Scramble for Africa</a>&quot; by defining
    &quot;effective occupation&quot; as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.[128] The
    scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan">Sudan</a>. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdist_War">Mahdi&rsquo;s Army</a> in 1896, and rebuffed an attempted French
    invasion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashoda_Incident">at Fashoda</a> in 1898. Sudan was nominally made
    an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_Sudan">Anglo-Egyptian condominium</a>, but a British colony
    in reality.</p>

<p>British gains in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa">Southern</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa">East Africa</a> prompted <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, pioneer of British expansion in Southern
    Africa, to urge a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_Railway">Cape to Cairo</a>&quot;
    railway linking the strategically important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal">Suez Canal</a> to the
    mineral-rich south of the continent. During the 1880s and 1890s, Rhodes, with his privately owned <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_South_Africa_Company">British South Africa Company</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_Rhodesia">occupied and annexed</a> territories subsequently
    named after him, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesia_(name)">Rhodesia</a>.</p>

<p>The 1839 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_on_the_Affairs_of_British_North_America">Durham Report</a>,
    proposed unification and self-government for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Canada">Upper</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Canada">Lower Canada</a>. Australia and New Zealand achieved
    self-government after 1900. The term &quot;dominion status&quot; was introduced at the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Conference">Colonial Conference of 1907</a>. The last decades of
    the 19th century saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign">political campaigns</a> for Irish <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule">home rule</a>. And the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress">Indian National Congress</a> was formed in 1885,
    initially loyal to the Empire but committed from 1905 to increased self-government, and to outright independence by
    1930.</p>

<p>Britain occupied most of Germany&#39;s overseas colonies in Africa at the outbreak of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War">First World War</a> (1914-1918), Australia and New Zealand
    occupied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_New_Guinea">German New Guinea</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa">Samoa</a> in the Pacific. Under the terms of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> signed in 1919, the empire
    reached its greatest extent with the addition of 1,800,000 square miles (4,700,000&nbsp;km2) and 13 million new
    subjects.</p>

<p>The colonies of Germany and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> were
    distributed to the Allied powers as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate">League of
        Nations mandates</a>. Whilst the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula became the kingdom of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. French mandates included <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_mandate_of_Syria">Syria</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_mandate_of_Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, Britain gained control of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine">Palestine</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan">Transjordan</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iraq_(Mandate_administration)">Iraq</a>, parts of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cameroons">Cameroon</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Togoland">Togoland</a>, and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanganyika_(territory)">Tanganyika</a>. The <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa">Union of South Africa</a> gained South West Africa
    (modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia">Namibia</a>), Australia gained <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_New_Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and New Zealand, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Samoa_Trust_Territory">Western Samoa</a>. <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru">Nauru</a> was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific
    Dominion.</p>

<p>The colonies were a major cause of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>. The
    war in the Pacific was caused by Japan&#39;s efforts to create a colonial empire in place of the existing empires
    held by the British, French, Dutch and the United States. The war in Europe and North Africa was caused partially by
    Germany and Italy&#39;s efforts to create colonial empires that sought to conquer existing British, French and
    Russian colonial empires in these areas</p>

<p>Although the British Empire emerged victorious from the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War">Second World War</a>, but Europe that had dominated the
    world for several centuries, was in ruins, and overrun over by the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union,
    who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the
    negotiation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan">a $US 4.33&nbsp;billion loan</a> from the
    United States, the last installment of which was repaid in 2006.</p>

<p>Therefore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization">decolonization</a>&nbsp;progressed rapidly after
    World War II. Firstly the image of the European was shattered by the Japanese occupation of British, French and
    Dutch territories in the East during the Second World War. Second, many colonial powers were significantly weakened
    by World War II. It led to the growth of independence movements in the colonies. Britain adopted a policy of
    peaceful disengagement from its colonies in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal, who waged
    costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact.</p>

<p>The first wave of European expansion involved exploring the world to find new revenue and perpetuating
    European&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism">feudalism</a>. The Spanish and Portuguese launched
    the colonisation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas">Americas</a>. Britain, France and the
    Netherlands followed them into Caribbean and North America.</p>

<p>The second wave focused on developing the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantile</a>&nbsp;capitalism system and the manufacturing
    industry in Europe, which commenced with Britain&#39;s involvement in Asia followed by France, Portugal and the
    Netherlands.</p>

<p>The last wave of European colonialism solidified capitalism by providing new markets and raw materials, regulated by
    the terms of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference">Berlin Conference</a>&nbsp;of
    1884&ndash;1885, whereby vast regions of Africa came under the sway of Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium,
    Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>The USA assumed Britain&#39;s role as the &quot;global hegemon&quot; in the 20th century, and continue globalization
    as &quot;anglobalisation&quot;. &nbsp;Advances in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation">transportation</a> (such as the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine">jet engine</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship">container ships</a>) and in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication">telecommunications</a> (including the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phones</a>) have been major factors in globalization,
    generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependence">interdependence</a> of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">economic</a> and cultural activities.</p>

<p>The industrialization changed western society. In preindustrial or nonindustrial society the <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/family-kinship">family</a> is the basic unit of production. In a typical
    example from early 18th-century <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/England">England</a>, the man might be a
    weaver and his wife a spinner, with the younger children acting as assistants in the joint domestic enterprise.
    Industrialization moved <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/production">production</a> away from the household
    to the factory, and the family was reduced to a unit of consumption. The small <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/nuclear-family">nuclear family</a> faced the impersonal, large-scale,
    bureaucratic world of work, adolescent alienation and teenage rebellion. <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/divorce">Divorce</a> rates soared. And one-parent families, headed by a
    woman, came into existence.</p>

<p>Tocqueville had warned that individuals lacking strong intermediate institutions might look to the protection of
    strong men and strong governments. The rise and success of totalitarian movements in some industrial societies
    showed that the tendencies were real and were present in some degree in all-modern societies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution">American</a> and <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution">French</a> revolutions had brought about a <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/constitutionalism">constitutional</a> and <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy">democratic</a> society, whereby no <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-system">political system</a> could claim legitimacy that was
    not in some sense based on the will of the people, constitutionally expressed. Unfortunately the new democratic
    legitimation was also claimed by popular or constitutional dictatorships such as those of Napoleon III in France or
    Adolf Hitler in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karl Marx was convinced that capitalism would throw up two main economic classes, the property less workers, or
    proletariat, and the capitalist or bourgeoisie owners, which would result in victory for the proletariat, who would
    establish a conflict free, classless society. Marx&rsquo;s prediction has not come about because ethnic, religious,
    and regional ties have submerged those based on economic interest.</p>

<p>And the discovery of the world&#39;s largest easily accessible crude oil deposits led to an influx of western <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_companies">oil companies</a>, making leaders of the oil states immensely
    rich, enabling them to consolidate their hold on power and giving them a stake in preserving Western hegemony over
    the region.</p>

<p>It is interesting that those countries, which emulated and adopted the British economic and social pattern in its
    entirety, became independent and powerful economically like Europe, USA and Japan, but those Asian, African and
    South American countries, which only borrowed technology, have remained backward and dependent on the west.</p>
