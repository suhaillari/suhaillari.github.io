    1888. He did his matric in 1902. He took B.A. degree in 1906, and M.A. in 1907 from the Forman Christian College,
    Lahore. He did his tripos in mathematics with distinction and won a scholarship from University of Cambridge,

    science. He then went to study in Paris. On his return to India he joined the Indian Educational Service and was
    appointed Vice-Principal of the Islamia College, Peshawar, and promoted as its Principal. He was transferred to the
    Government of India as Under-Secretary in the Education Department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He resigned from Government Service in 1924 and wrote Tazkira, a commentary on Islam and the principles of
    self-reform. He was invited to Khilafat Conference held in Egypt in 1926. He went to Germany and met Hitler in
    1929. In 1930 he returned from Europe and founded Khaksar movement in September 1931 with headquarter in Ichra at
    Lahore. He described the aim and object of his party in a second book called Isharat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allama Mashriqi wanted to turn the Muslim community into a military body. He organized the Khaksars as soldiers of
    Islam to establish a sovereign state of Muslims. He aimed at infusing a military spirit among them.&nbsp;The
    volunteers of the Khaksar movement were expected to participate daily in military parade and social work. They were
    seen drilling and parading in playgrounds, streets and neighborhoods wearing khaki uniforms with spades on their
    shoulders.&nbsp;All members, regardless of rank, wore the same uniform; a khaki shirt with khaki&nbsp;<em>pajama</em>with
    military boots. They wore a red badge (<em>akhuwat</em>) on their right arm as a symbol of brotherhood. On their
    heads Khaksars wore a white cloth the length and width of one and one-half yards, which was secured around the head
    with a cotton string. All Khaksars carried a&nbsp;<em>bailcha</em>&nbsp;(spade).The flag of the Khaksars was a
    crescent moon and a star on a red background.</p>
<p>Allama Mashriqi outlined twenty-four principles on 29 November 1936 in an address to a Khaksar&nbsp;camp at&nbsp;<a
        title="Sialkot" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialkot">Sialkot</a>.He conceded that the success of Muslim
    rule in India necessitated a regard for the religious and social sentiments of the various communities, the
    maintenance of their particular culture and customs, and a general tolerance.</p>
<p>In 1939, Allama put forward three demands to the Punjab government; permission to own a broadcasting station, to
    collect zakat for establishing a baitulmal and for government servants to join the movement. Allama announced a
    recruitment drive to achieve strength of 2,500,000 by February 1940. Allama published a pamphlet titled,&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Kia
        Hindustan main ainda hukamat ka miar aksariat ya khun hoga,</em>which was considered objectionable by the
    government and banned and a security was demanded from the printers and publishers. On 28 February 1940, the
    Government of Punjab issued orders under Rules 58 and 54 of the Defense of India Rules prohibiting the performance
    of exercises of a military nature and carrying of arms in processions. These were regarded by the Khaksars as a
    challenge and the official organ, the Al-Islah, in its issue of 15 March 1940, condemned the orders as threat to
    the movement and declared that even if all the leaders were arrested the movement would not subside until every
    Khaksar had bathed in blood. The same issue of the paper contained the instructions under the title of
    &lsquo;orders from headquarters&rsquo;, that if the Punjab Government declares war, the provincial leaders of 15
    provinces of India should send 30,000 Khaksar soldiers to Lahore within one week. All soldiers should obey the
    orders of Deputy Leader at Lahore whose orders will be absolute and final. The number of Janbaz (those pledged to
    give their lives) was 1,300. They were asked to arrive as soon as possible. In case war is declared, they should
    reach the bed of Sir Sikander within five days from every part of India, and surround it with corpses.</p>
<p>On the morning of 19 March 1940, Khaksars were assembled in Unchi mosque. They brushed aside the small police force
    near the Tibbi Police Station. Additional police party barred their way to Badshahi mosque. It faced brickbats and
    soda water thrown by the prostitutes living there, followed by firing.</p>
<p>Allama Mashraqi was arrested by the Delhi police on Sunday 19 March 1940. A police party aided by troops went to
    Idara-i-Alia (the Khaksar headquarters) at Ichra in Lahore about 5.45 pm. It was met by about 40 Khaksars drawn in
    two lines in front of their tents. They had bailchas and were new arrivals from NWFP. There was other detachment of
    Khaksars inside the Idara. A fight ensued and the Khaksars who died at Lahore on 19 March 1940 were 32. According
    to CM, 29 died and 217 arrested in Lahore. The IG KS Mir Afzal Khan and a sub Inspector were injured. Two
    constables were killed. SP Gainsford and DSP Beatty injured seriously and were admitted in Albert Victor Hospital.</p>
<p>On Thursday 21 March 1940, Khaksars again defied ban in Lahore. They made sudden appearance about 3 p.m. from their
    hidden places and marched up and down Anarkali. FC Bourne Deputy Commission who had not recovered from the facial
    wound received on Tuesday conducted the operation assisted by Bennett DIG CID and city magistrate Sardar Abdus
    Samad Khan. Every attempt was made to induce them to lay down their arms but they refused. The tear gas squad threw
    about half a dozen bombs and eight Khaksars temporarily blinded were arrested. Two Khaksars were wounded and died
    bringing the total number of deaths to 31.</p>
<p>Securities of Rs. 3,000 was demanded from the editor, printer and publisher of al-Islah for publishing an article
    against the Punjab government and a security of Rs. 2,000 was demanded from the Din Duniya Press, were the al-Islah
    was published. The police arrested Mohd Hussain Bhatti district commander of the Amritsar Khaksars and two others.
    The house of Noor Mohd Kabuli organizer of the khaksars in Multan was searched and several bailchas were seized. In
    an article in Al-Islah, Mashriqi ordered his janbaz to proceed to Lahore and lay a bed of corpses at Sir
    Sikander&rsquo;s door. Allama Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi was detained to prevent him from acting in a manner
    prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of war.</p>
<p>Five Pathan Khaksars in uniform with their bailchas came from Cambelpur district on 24 March 1940 and went inside
    the golden mosque at Dabbi bazar in Lahore and started parading in the courtyard. A large crowd gathered which was
    addressed by the Khaksars, one after the other. Police arrived and the city magistrate asked them to surrender but
    they refused.</p>
<p>Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung accompanied by KS Mian Amiruddin went to jail to meet Mr. Shafi the Lahore Salar of the
    Khaksar and informed him that Mr. Jinnah was negotiating with the Government therefore he authorized them to ask
    them to surrender the bailchas and uniforms to the police and suspend their satyagraha, which they did. Nine
    Khaksars demonstrated in the Anarkali chowk near Nila Gumbad. Eight more Khaksars were arrested at Jullunder.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 11 June 1940, Khaksars were rounded up at Lahore. 300 were arrested and one Khaksar was killed. On
    Wednesday 12 June 1940 Khaksars began using mosques as places of hiding.</p>
<p>On 7<sup>th</sup>July 1940 Dr. Mohd Ismail Nami present leader of Khaksar movement ordered suspension of defiance of
    law till 27<sup>th</sup>July, pending negotiation by Jinnah with Punjab government.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 2nd December 1941, Allama Mashriqui, was moved to Madras jail by Banglore express andkept in jail without
    any legal proceedings. In protest, he fasted to the point of death. Mashraqi was released from Jail on 19 January
    1942, but his movements were restricted to Madras Presidency where he remained interned until 28 December 1942.
    Mashraqi arrived in New Delhi on 2 January 1943.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hundreds of letters and telegrams by Khaksars to Jinnah started arriving asking him to seek interview with Gandhi
    for a settlement and threatening Jinnah with dire consequences and abusing him as a tool of the British. Khaksar
    Mohd Sadiq alias Rafiq Sabir Mazangavi attacked Jinnah on the noon of 25<sup>th</sup>July 1943 in Bombay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council of AIML on Monday 15<sup>th</sup>November 1943 adopted a resolution, asking the members of the League
    not to become members of the Khaksar organization and to resign from it, as the organization has had shown by its
    writings and activities that it is pursuing a general policy which is hostile and antagonistic to the AIML. Hamid
    Nizami of Punjab and Ashraf of Meerut opposed it.</p>
<p>Allama Mashriqi disbanded the Khaksar Tehrik on 4 July 1947 considering that the Muslims of India were satisfied
    with the hope of a new separate Muslim state of&nbsp;<a title="Pakistan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.</p>
