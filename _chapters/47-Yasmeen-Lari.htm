<p>2003 Author, Lahore Heritage Guide, published by Heritage Foundation,</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation was the first organization that began systematic cataloguing and working on saving historic urban structures.</p>

<p>Ms Lari was the first to start preserving the heritage in Pakistan. The GPO on Mall Road Lahore had caught fire and was slated for demolition. The other was Flagstaff House in Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act 1994, proposed by Ms. Lari, was unanimously passed by the Sindh Assembly. Thereby about 600 buildings documented by her in Karachi were preserved, and a committee was formed to implement the law and to document and protect more buildings. But Abdul Hamid Akhund, secretary to the governor and the culture secretary, and Hameed Haroon got themselves nominated onto the committee, and did their best to defeat the act by not implementing its purpose which was, to document and save the heritage of the whole of Sindh. Akhund used to say that. Lari had got the Heritage Act passed with a gun at his head. By that what he meant was that despite being the blue eyed boy of governor Mehmood Haroon and soulmate of Hameed Haroon, he was helpless before the support she had of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Chief Minister Abdullah Shah and the opposition in the Sindh Assembly.</p>

<p>Ms. Lari created Karavan Karachi to generate public awareness and support for heritage. Karavan Karachi met every Sunday at a heritage building where school bands would start playing in the afternoon to attract people. With thousands of people watching, the chief guest would place a plaque on the heritage building, followed by speeches, plays, skits, and music shows relating to heritage offered by schools and theatre groups.</p>

<p>She devised the Karavan MeraPakistan programme, to safe-guard historic buildings, to foster a duty of care for heritage assets, to develop pride and a stake in the city by initiating a sustained process of cleaning and washing Karachi&#39;s heritage. This was done by involving school children and by white washing posters from walls and replacing them with paintings by students. These functions were held in Karachi from 2001-2004, followed by several cities ranging from Bahawlpur Palaces, Darawar Fort and the World Heritage Sites of Lahore&#39;s Shahi Qila and Taxila.</p>

<p>When one of the important heritage sites in Pakistan, that is the Shish Mahal of Lahore Fort, was endangered, the Heritage Foundation chief Yasmeen Lari was appointed National Advisor for conservation and preservation of Lahore Fort by UNESCO, and was asked by UNESCO to to save it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The documentation of Peshawar city was also taken up in collaboration with UNESCO and a publication on Peshawar city was brought out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; UNESCO also appointed her to co-author the Master Plan of Lahore Fort, which identified problem areas and worked out strategies for the management of the entire World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>The Hertage Foundation received the UN Recognition Award 2002 for promotion of culture and peace.</p>

<p>UNESCO devoted a chapter to <s>Ms</s>. Yasmeen Lari as one of sixty women from all over the world who had made a significant contribution to UNESCO since its inception.</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation has, without any assistance or funding from the government, helped people build, in over a hundred and fifty villages, over forty thousand earthquake and flood resistant houses, over thirty thousand smokeless chulas and hundreds of latrines at almost zero carbon footprint, which is the largest zero carbon intervention in the world.</p>

<p>A test at NED College Laboratory was conducted in the presence of the vice chancellor himself and representatives of international agencies, and it was found that Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s earth, lime and bamboo structures could withstand over twice the intensity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, without showing any damage to the structure.</p>

<p>Her work was filmed by a prize-winning Indian film maker named Faiza, and broadcast by Aljazera TV in their series on rebel architecture. Safeeyah Moosa of South Africa sent a photographer to film her work, which was broadcast on ten TV stations in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Heritage Foundation chief executive Yasmeen Lari is the only Pakistani architect whose work has been exhibited from January to April 2016 by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and she was invited by them to lecture and conduct workshop in London on how to work with sustainable materials with low/zero carbon footprint.</p>

<p>2013 Ms. Lari was declared Islamic Development Bank (Jeddah) Laureate, Ms. Lari&rsquo;s work has been exhibited in the First Chicago Architectural Biennale. That due to her innovative approaches she has been invited to speak at the Oslo Architectural Triennale in September 2016.</p>

<p>The Phaidon Press Limited of Regent&rsquo;s Wharf, All Saints Street, London, and 180 Varick Street New York NY 10014, published an encyclopedia of the 20th Century World Architecture built between 1900 and 1999, in 97 countries of the world, comprising every imaginable building type, from the smallest single houses, cafes and zoo structures to huge utopian housing projects, centres of government, and new universities. The experts from the building industry, chose 757 examples of the most outstanding work done during the twentieth century, from a selection made by over 150 specialist advisors from every geographical region of the world. One of the works selected was house in Karachi, designed by Yasmeen Lari.</p>
