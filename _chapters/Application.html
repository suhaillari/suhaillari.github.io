<p align="center"><strong><u>APPLICATION&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>FOR RESTRAINING THE ABOVE NAMED RESPONDENTS FROM DEFAMATORY ACTIONS, BLACKMAILING AND
			COERCIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE PETITIONER</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>That the Respondents have no answer and have not replied to the Petitioner&rsquo;s plea</strong>/response
		dated 30<sup>th</sup>December 2015 in Human Rights Case No 8730-S/2915 (Annexure &lsquo;E&rsquo;).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>That instead the Respondents have started blackmailing</strong>to force the Petitioner to withdraw my
		above Human Rights Case No 8730-S/2915.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>That Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund</strong>of Respondents 2 &amp; 3 who is&nbsp;<strong>neither an architect nor
			a structural engineer</strong>, has falsely and&nbsp;<strong>mischievously alleged</strong>in his letter dated 16
		February to Respondent No 1 that &ldquo;the Heritage Foundation has about 2-3 months back damaged the outer shell of
		the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim, which puts the&nbsp;<strong>structural integrity of the dome at risk</strong>&rdquo;
		(Annexure &lsquo;A&rsquo;).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>That Mr. Qasim Ali Qasim</strong>, Director of Archaeology &amp; Museums, Sindh Culture Tourism &amp;
		Antiquities Department of Respondent No 1,&nbsp;<strong>who is an MA in History, replied to Mr. Akhund the same day,
			wrongly stating that &ldquo;the Dome has been damaged</strong>by M/s Heritage Foundation and necessary action is
		under way&rdquo; (Annexure &lsquo;B&rsquo;).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
	<li>That the Respondents have made the&nbsp;<strong>allegation of damage without seeing the tomb, which is kept,
			locked by the Petitioner</strong>. That in fact in a letter to the Petitioner, Respondent No 1 has complained that
		he has not been able to visit the tomb as it is kept locked by her.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li>That to harass and defame the Petitioner, daily Dawn managed by&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Hameed Haroon of Respondent 2,
			has published the false news</strong>with the heading, &lsquo;Historical Sultan Ibrahim tomb damaged during
		rehabilitation work&rsquo; (Annexure &lsquo;C&rsquo;).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
	<li>That none of the Respondents named above have defined or detailed the nature or extent of the alleged damage, as
		they have not been inside the tomb.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
	<li><strong>That to harass and defame the Petitioner further, the Respondent No 1 has stopped M/s Heritage Foundation
			from carrying on any work at the site</strong>(Annexure &lsquo;D&rsquo;).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>GROUNDS</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>That the 20<sup>th</sup>Century World Architecture Atlas, comprising architecture between 1900 and 1999 in 97
		countries of the world, published in from London and New York, has chosen one of the&nbsp;<strong>Petitioner&rsquo;s
			works among the 757 most outstanding works built during the twentieth century</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li>That the&nbsp;<strong>Petitioner has received the UN recognition award for her work,</strong>and UNESCO has
		devoted a chapter on the Petitioner as one of sixty women from all over the world who have made a significant
		contribution to UNESCO since its inception.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
	<li>That<strong>UNESCO, which is the repository of heritage all over the world appointed the Petitioner, the National
			Advisor</strong>and the leader of the team to restore the endangered Shish Mahal and prepare a master plan of
		Lahore Fort.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
	<li>That the Petitioner was one of the&nbsp;<strong>first to document and help save the urban heritage of Pakistan.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
	<li>That when GPO on Mall Road in Lahore caught fire and was to be demolished the Petitioner restored it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li>That when Flagstaff House, the Hindu Gymkhana and Mohatta Palace in Karachi came under threat the Petitioner
		documented them and&nbsp;<strong>restored Flagstaff House as Quaid-i-Azam House Museum despite opposition by
			the&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>group.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
	<li>That the Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act 1994,&nbsp;<strong>proposed by the Petitioner was unanimously
			passed by the Sindh Assembly,</strong><strong>whereby about 600 Karachi buildings catalogued and published by me
			were notified and provided protection.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
	<li>That the then secretary to the Government of Sindh,&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund, Respondent of No. 2
			&amp; 3, is reputed to have said that it had been passed at gunpoint.</strong>By that he meant that despite being
		the blue-eyed boy of Sindh Governor Mahmood Haroon and soul-mate of Mr. Hameed Haroon of&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>, he was
		helpless before the support the Pettitioner had of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Chief Minister Abdullah Shah and
		the opposition in the Sindh Assembly.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
	<li>That the Respondents got themselves nominated to the Advisory Committee under the Sindh Cultural Heritage
		(Preservation) Act 1994, to defeat its purpose. After about two decades even its byelaws have not been formulated
		and meetings are held irregularly. That thousands of heritage structures are languishing in Karachi, Shikarpoor,
		Hyderabad and other districts of Sindh. And, several hundred heritage structures in Karachi and other Sindh cities
		have been declared dangerous.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
	<li>That therefore I, the Petitioner resigned from the Advisory Committee and to counter their attempt to delist
		heritage buildings, I created Karavan Karachi to generate public awareness and support for heritage. Karavan Karachi
		met every Sunday at a heritage building where school, Pakistan Army or Pakistan Navy bands would start playing in
		the afternoon to attract people. With thousands of people watching, the chief guest would place a plaque on the
		heritage building, followed by speeches, plays, skits, and music shows relating to heritage offered by schools and
		theatre groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="11">
	<li>That further, without any assistance or funding from the government, in over fifteen hundred villages of Sindh
		alone, affected by flood and earthquake, the Petitioner has helped people build over forty thousand earthquake and
		flood proof houses at almost zero carbon footprint, as well as over thirty thousand smokeless chulahs and latrines,
		benefitting over 300,000 persons.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="12">
	<li>That the Petitioner&rsquo;s work for flood and earthquake affected communities is being exhibited at RIBA as the
		work of one of eight architects chosen from around the world, titled &ldquo;Creativity from Catastrophe&rdquo;,
		beginning with Christopher Wren who rebuilt London after the Great Fire.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="13">
	<li>That to influence the Petitioner, the Respondents had the Petitioner nominated to the Endowment Fund Trust and
		Mohatta Palace Museum Board of Governors/Trust. That as a member of their boards, the Petitioner constantly pointed
		out flaws and proposed improvements, but it had no effect and the Secretary, in both cases the Respondents No. 2
		&amp; 3 Mr. Akhund, drafted minutes which were false or which twisted my statements.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="14">
	<li>That therefore the Petitioner proposed in the presence of Governor Sindh that all of us should resign and be
		de-notified, and that new boards should be constituted, as some members had been there for too long to do much good:
		but the government officials and politicians are all afraid of the&nbsp;<em>Dawn</em>media empire.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="15">
	<li>That the Petitioner was making a speech bemoaning the state of heritage in Sindh when a former judge of the
		Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court among the audience suggested that the Petitioner should petition the Hon&rsquo;ble
		Supreme Court to save the heritage and history of our country.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="16">
	<li>That the Petitioner&rsquo;s simple plea to the Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court dated 30 December 2015 (Annexure
		&lsquo;E&rsquo;), is that no organization or institution formed with public funds should have anyone nominated or
		elected for more than two years and more than two terms, and that no one should be appointed without merit and
		public advertisement, while their balance sheets and activities should be placed on their websites for everyone to
		study.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="17">
	<li>That in retaliation the Respondents have tried to defame and blackmail the Petitioner by publishing false news in
		the media under their control, that the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim has been damaged during rehabilitation work by the
		Heritage Foundation (Annexure &lsquo;C&rsquo;) when neither Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund (Respondent No 2 &amp; 3) nor Mr.
		Qasim Ali Qasim (Respondent no 1), who have made the allegation, are architects or structural engineers.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="18">
	<li>That the media group controlled by Respondents 2 &amp; 3 also stated that US $260,000 has been provided by the US
		Ambassadors Fund to the Heritage Foundation (Annexure &lsquo;F&rsquo;). That in fact the US embassy reimburses the
		expenses only after scrutinizing the expenses incurred by the Heritage Foundation.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="19">
	<li>That neither any director nor the Petitioner takes any salary, dividend, or profit from Heritage Foundation. Can
		Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund and Mr. Qasim Ali Qasim say the same?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="20">
	<li>That to further harass me they have got Culture Department to stop me from working on the tomb of Sultan Ibrahim
		and formed a committee to investigate alleged damage to the said tomb.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="21">
	<li>That they have ignored the fact that the&nbsp;<strong>US Ambassadors&rsquo; Fund regularly sends expert from
			Washington to inspect our work.</strong>That the expert last visited the tomb and dome of Sultan Ibrahim on 3<sup>rd</sup>February
		2016, and approved the works carried out there.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="22">
	<li>That recently&nbsp;<strong>a high powered team of experts from UNESCO inspected all our work at Makli on 19th
			February 2016</strong>, and praised all the work executed by us there including conservation work on Sultan
		Ibrahim&rsquo;s tomb.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="23">
	<li>That the Petitioner has formed a consultative committee of experts which visits Sultan Ibrahim&rsquo;s tomb to
		evaluate the work of our artisans, architects and experts, and the reports are published on our website for everyone
		to see.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p align="center"><strong><u>PRAYER</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the light of above facts&nbsp;the Petitionerhumbly prays that the Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court may be pleased to
	issue directives against the respondents:&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="24">
	<li>To direct the Sindh Government to ask UNESCO, which is responsible for all the World Heritage Sites, to undertake
		a review of the state of World Heritage Site Makli, as well as the work carried out by us and the work carried out
		by others.</li>
	<li>To direct the Respondents not to take any coercive action against the Petitioner, that their attempt at
		blackmailing should be stopped and a restraining order may kindly be issued to the daily &lsquo;<em>Dawn</em>&rsquo;
		not to publish further defamatory material related to the Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s work at Makli.</li>
	<li>That action may kindly be taken against defamation against&nbsp;the Petitionerby the Respondents, who would like
		me to withdraw my Human Rights case pending before the Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>That a restraining order may kindly be issued against the respondents not to perform any illegal or coercive
		action and not to pressurize the Petitioner for withdrawal of this petition.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>That the Heritage Foundation may kindly be allowed to continue with its conservation work at Makli.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Any other relief which this Hon&rsquo;able Court deems fit and appropriate in the instant case may kindly be
		granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
