<p>Begum Viqar-un-Nisa, known as Lady Vicky Noon (1920-2000) was an Austrian named Victoria, who was brought up and educated in London where she got to know Sir Malik Feroz Khan Noon (1893-1970), who was then High Commissioner for India in England. He was recalled to India in 1941 to become a member of Viceroy&rsquo;s Council and later a member of Churchill&rsquo;s Commonwealth War Cabinet. Meanwhile Vicky was married to a Sikh and came to India with him where he again met Malik sahib. They had both a second marriage in 1945. She took active part in the independence movement with her husband against the Khizar government in Punjab and was arrested thrice. After independence she looked after refugees and joined the Red Cross. She also became involved in women&rsquo;s education and founded a girls school in Dhaka and a women&rsquo;s college in Rawalpindi. She was awarded Pakistan&rsquo;s highest civilian award, the Nishane Imtiaz in 1959. She held chair of Pakistan Red Crescent till 1972. She served as Ambassador to Portugal (1987-1989). She inherited money in England from her step-sister and brother-in-law who died childless which she utilized along with her own inheritance to create a foundation for Pakistani students to study at Oxbridge. In old age she retired to her cottage in Abbottabad where we last met her. After recurring illness she died on 16 January 2000. Lady Noon was the Federal Minister of Tourism (1978-1987) under General Zia therefore she often came to Karachi often and each time she came she asked us to arrange lunch at our house so that she could meet her friends in Karachi.</p>

<p>The closest friend of Lady Noon in Karachi was Begum Qamar Ispahani who was an Iranian lady married to Mirza Abul Hasan Ispahani, one of the three blue eyed boys of the Quaid-i-Azam and the only one who remained in his good books till his death. Although she was Persian speaking she did not like to be called Persian because according to her, Persians were subject people who had been ruled all through Islamic history by Arabs or Central Asians. We became close because we had the same views on the subject and wrote a book propounding the idea, called &ldquo;Neither Islamic nor Persian&rdquo;, which stated, &lsquo;after the defeat of the Sasanian Empire and its occupation by the Muslim Arabs, the Persian Empire ceased to exist and that Persia (Fars) is now the name of a small province in southern Iran, and the word Persian denotes the common language of various Aryan tribes from Central Asia who had settled in Iran about BC 1500. Apart from the two periods of the Achaemenians (BC 550-330) and the Sasanians (226-652 AD), Iran has never been ruled by Persians. Before the Arabs, Iran has also been ruled by the Elamites, Assyrians, Medes, Greeks and Parthians. Since the Arab conquest of Iran in the seventh century, the elite and the ruling families of Iran have been Arabs and Central Asian Steppe peoples - the Mamluke, the Seljuk, the Mongol, the Timurid and the Turkoman. And throughout its history, the Persian language has been written in foreign scripts of Semitic origin. Before the Arab conquest they were written in Aramaic and since then in the Arabic script. It is therefore not surprising that Arabs called Iran Ajam, the land of barbarians, a people without a tongue&rsquo;. Begum Qamar Ispahani founded an orphanage for girls in Karachi called Kashana-i-Itfal. She represented Pakistan at the Geneva based National Council of Child Welfare and was recipient of Nishan-i-Imtiaz from Government of Pakistan and Italy&rsquo;s Cavalleri award.</p>
