title: Dawn distorts history of Sir Muhammad Iqbal
section: 4

<p>The <em>Dawn</em> newspaper published on Saturday 11 June 2017, a full-page article, &lsquo;ALLAHABAD 1930: AN
    ADDRESS TO REMEMBER&rsquo;, with text and photographs, and on the basis of this address hailed Iqbal as the dreamer
    and originator of the Pakistan idea. Dawn wrote that &lsquo;in his address, Sir Muhammad Iqbal set out his vision of
    an independent state for the Muslim majority provinces of undivided India&rsquo;. Dawn later incorporated this
    article in a booklet that Dawn published under the title, &lsquo;Dawn of Pakistan&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Although this has been contradicted by Iqbal himself. Iqbal wrote to E. J. Thompson on 4 March 1934, &lsquo;I have
    just received your review of my book. It is excellent and I am grateful to you for the very kind things you have
    said of me. But you have made one mistake, which I hasten to point out as I consider it rather serious. You call me
    the protagonist of the scheme called &ldquo;Pakistan&rdquo;. Now Pakistan is not my scheme. The one that I suggested
    in my address is the creation of a Muslim Province &ndash; i.e. a province having an overwhelming population of
    Muslims in the North-West of India. This new province will be, according to my scheme, a part of the proposed Indian
    Federation.&rsquo;. The photographic reproduction of this letter of Iqbal to E. J. Thompson is in a booklet written
    by S. Hasan Ahmad of the Aligarh University in 1979 on <em>Iqbal: his political ideas at crossroads; a commentary on
        unpublshed letters to Prof. Thompson with photographic reproductions of the original letters. </em>Further,
    Khalid Ahmed writes in the Friday Times, September 5-11,2003, that Muhammad Faridul Haq&#39;s book <em>Iqbal:
        Jahan-e-Deegar</em> (1983), contains a facsimile of a letter by Iqbal to Raghib Ahsan in which Iqbal clearly
    states; &#39;I propose to create a Muslim province within the Indian federation&#39;.</p>

<p><em>Dawn</em> also distorts history when it<em> </em>prints a picture of Yusuf Haroon standing next to a swanky car
    with Allama Iqbal sitting in it on 29 December 1930 in Allahabad. In fact, according to his son, Justice Javed
    Iqbal, Allama went to Allahabad by train, and came back by train, and walked round Allahabad on foot. This reminds
    me that Yusuf Haroon told me that, &lsquo;if I had another life I would support Lari every time, because Lari always
    spoke the truth&rsquo;. Therefore if you want a true account of Pakistan then you should read my e-book, which was
    put on the internet by a South African but was hacked by someone who did not like the truth. It has now been placed
    in USA on the Google as Suhail Lari Pakistan and in South Africa as Suhail Lari Legacy Unlocked. It can also be
    reached on Google by clicking on suhail zaheer lari.</p>

<p>The truth is that Iqbal was invited to the twenty-first session of the All-India Muslim League to be held in
    Allahabad from 29 to 31 December, 1930. He delivered his presidential address on 29 December, 1930 to an audience of
    about 600, which dwindled next morning to 25 persons, thus lacking even the quorum of 75. Iqbal left after an hour
    and the session ended on the second day instead of lasting for three days.</p>

<p>It was because in his address, Iqbal was for the All Parties Muslim Conference, founded by the Aga Khan, which wanted
    to bring together all the communities as against the Muslim League, which the Aga Khan considered to be a communal
    organisation.</p>

<p>Further, Iqbal put forward the idea of &lsquo;the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan
    amalgamated into a single State&rsquo;. In his address, Iqbal said, &lsquo;The Punjab with a 56 per cent Muslim
    population supplies 54 per cent of total combatant troops in the Indian army&rsquo;, and if Gurkhas are excluded,
    &lsquo;the Punjab contingent amounts to 62 per cent of the whole Indian army&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Therefore Iqbal said that, &lsquo;I have no hesitation in declaring that, if the principle that the Indian Muslim is
    entitled to full and free development on the line of his own culture and traditions in his own homelands, is
    recognized as the basis of a permanent settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India ... It
    will intensify their sense of responsibility and their patriotic feeling. Thus, possessing full opportunity of
    development within the body-politic of India, the North West Indian Muslims will prove the best defenders of India
    against a foreign invasion, be that invasion one of ideas or bayonets ... I therefore demand the formation of a
    consolidated Muslim state in the best interests of India and Islam. For India it means security and peace resulting
    from an internal balance of power; for Islam, an opportunity to rid itself of the stamp that Arabian imperialism was
    forced to give it, to mobilise its laws, its education, its culture, and to bring them into closure contact with its
    own original spirit and with the spirit of modern times&rsquo; (Zaidi, Vol iv, 66-68).&rsquo;</p>

<p>Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialkot">Sialkot</a>. His ancestors
    were&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Brahmin">Kashmiri Brahmins</a>&nbsp;of the Sapru clan who
    had converted to Islam. His grandfather migrated to Punjab, where Iqbal&#39;s father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad (died
    1930), was a tailor and mother Imam Bibi, was from Sialkot.</p>

<p>Iqbal married thrice. He first married in 1895, when he was 18 years old. His bride Karim Bibi was the daughter of a
    physician, Khan Bahadur Ata Muhammad Khan. They had two children; a daughter Miraj Begum (1895&ndash;1915) and a
    son, Aftab Iqbal (1899&ndash;1979). Another son died at birth. Iqbal&#39;s second marriage was with Mukhtar Begum in
    December 1914.&nbsp;They had a son, but both the mother and son died shortly after birth in 1924.
    &nbsp;Iqbal&rsquo;s third wife was Sardar Begum from whom he had a son,&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javed_Iqbal_(judge)">Javed Iqbal</a>&nbsp;(1924&ndash;2015), and a daughter
    Muneera Bano (b. 1930).</p>

<p>Iqbal was four years old when he was admitted to the&nbsp;<a

    he&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation">matriculated</a>&nbsp;in 1893, and did <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_2">Intermediate</a> in 1895. He did his BA in

    Lahore, where he was influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Walker_Arnold">Sir Thomas
        Arnold</a>, the philosophy teacher at Government College Lahore who encouraged him to go abroad.</p>

<p>Iqbal qualified for a scholarship and did his BA from&nbsp;<a

            in Persia</em></a>. During his study in Europe, Iqbal began to write poetry in Persian. He returned from
    England and joined the Government College again as a professor of philosophy and English literature. Iqbal also
    began practicing law at Chief Court Lahore, but he soon quit law practice and devoted himself in literary works,
    becoming an active member of&nbsp;<a

    deepest influence on Iqbal&#39;s mind that he featured as his guide in many of his poems. Iqbal&#39;s works focused
    on reminding his readers of the past glories of Islamic civilisation, and delivering the message of Islam. Iqbal
    ceased practicing law in 1934 and was granted a pension by the&nbsp;<a

<p>Allama Sir Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was one of the greatest poet-philosophers of Islam who gave Muslims new confidence with
    stories of their conquests, and put forward the concepts like <em>Ishq,</em> <em>Khudi </em>and <em>Shaheen</em>.
</p>

<p><em>Ishq dam-e Jibrail, Ishq dil-e Mustafa</em></p>

<p><em>Ishq khuda ka rasul, Ishq khuda ka kalam</em></p>

<p><em>Khudi ko kar buland Itna, kay her taqdeer say pehlay</em></p>

<p><em>Khuda banday say khud poochay, bata teri raza kiya hai</em></p>

<p><em>Tu Shaheen hai parwaz hai kam tera</em></p>

<p><em>Tere Samnay Asman aur bhi hain</em></p>

<p>However, Iqbal also wrote the beautiful poem, which is sometimes used in Bharat, Hindustan, India, in place of its
    national anthem;</p>

<p><em>Sāre jahāṉ se acchā, Hindositāṉ&nbsp;hamārā</em><br />
    <em>Ham bulbuleṉ haiṉ is kī, yih gulsitāṉ&nbsp;hamārā</em></p>

<p>(Better than the entire world, is our&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_India#Hindustan_and_Hind">Hindustan</a>,<br />
    We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode)</p>
