<p>The newspaper <em>Dawn</em>, was funded by members of the All India Muslim League in their struggle for Pakistan, and founded by the Father of the Nation in Delhi. After independence, Muslim League journalists brought <em>Dawn</em> newspaper from Delhi to Karachi, and printed it on the Muslim League press set up by the local Muslim League leader, Mr. Yusuf Haroon.</p> <p>Mr. Yusuf Haroon was the son of Memon Seth Haji Sir Abdoola Haroon, a President of the All India Memon Conference of Kathiawar, and one of the richest businessmen of Sindh. Sir Abdoola Haroon, had joined the All-India Muslim Conference which was established by the Aga Khan against the Muslim League, as a platform for Muslims who wanted to bring about harmonious relations between various religious communities, and they considered the Muslim League to be communal.</p> <p>Sir Abdoola Haroon held a meeting at his residence on Sunday 7 June 1936, to discuss the formation of the Sindh Unionist Party/the Sind Ittehad Party. The Sindh Unionist Party/the Sind Ittehad Party of Haji Sir Abdoola Haroon and Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto was described by Shaikh Abdul Majid as &lsquo;a frantic effort on the part of some well-known Muslim reactionaries to secure their own position in the future government&rsquo;. Shaikh Abdul Majid vowed to oppose Sir Abdoola Haroon and Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the stalwarts of the Sindh Unionist Party/the Sind Ittehad Party in the Sindh Legislative Assembly election held on 31 January 1937, and in fact both were defeated. After the defeat, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto left Sindh and Sir Abdoola Haroon tried to mend his relations with Jinnah and the Muslim League.</p> <p>Yusuf Haroon took out Herald in place of <em>Dawn</em> in April 1950, but this was foiled by people supported by the Madar-i-Millat Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah, who came out with the statement that<strong> &lsquo;</strong><em>Dawn</em> belonged to the nation and could not be treated as the property of an individual&rsquo;.</p> <p>When Mr. Altaf Husain, editor of Dawn appointed by the Quaid-i-Azam, agreed to join the cabinet of Ayub Khan after the defeat of Miss Fatima Jinnah in the election for president, Yusuf Haroon became the chief editor of Dawn. However, Mr. Yusuf Haroon came in conflict with the government and was forced to leave the country. He appointed Altaf Gauhar, who had been working with me on a soda ash project for East Africa, as chief editor of <em>Dawn. </em>Altaf Gauhar asked me to join him in Dawn, which was his attempt to repay for the support that we had given him after his dismissal from the government by President Yahya Khan. Therefore I thanked him but did not accept. Altaf Gauhar appointed S. R. Ghouri, who had been sacked by Mr. Bhutto as editor of the Morning News to make a place for Sultan Ahmed as its &nbsp;editor.</p> <p>The attacking editorials of Altaf Gauhar and the biting columns of Ghouri rattled Mr. Bhutto. Once when Mr. Bhutto said in a public speech referring to Altaf Gauhar that &lsquo;the Himalya will cry&rsquo;, Altaf wrote an editorial saying that mountains do not cry. Mr. Bhutto in his next public speech, referring to Altaf Gauhar&rsquo;s specs said that, &lsquo;the editor, despite his four eyes, cannot see that rivers gush forth out of mountains when mountains cry&rsquo;. As Gauhar and Ghouri would not stop criticising the Bhutto government this culminated in the arrest of Altaf Gauhar and the sacking of Ghouri. While Altaf Gauhar accepted Abidi&rsquo;s invitation to live in U.K. and take out his magazine. Mr. Ghouri survived by joining two of the most important foreign newspapers and writing for them in his usual forthwrite manner. This annoyed the government but gave him protection from direct assault, because Mr. Bhutto was not prepared to annoy the foreign press. However, the government made sure that Ghouri did not even get a place to set up an office from where he could operate. Therefore I offered him rooms on eighth floor of my office. He asked for separate locks for the rooms, because he thought that intelligence people might try to break into his office. But he came a few days later to thank me and say that he and his family were being threatened and abused all the time, and he would not like it to happen to me. Ghouri also ultimately left to live in USA.</p> <p>Yusuf Haroon handed over <em>Dawn</em> to his younger brother Mehmood, who made his brother-in-law Khawaja Rehman (Mana ji), the CEO of Dawn, who received two bullets on the Boat Club stairs and carried one of them till his dying day. Mr. Mehmood Haroon compromised with the government and used <em>Dawn </em>to become Governor of Sindh, federal minister, etc. After the death of Mana ji, he employed one of his nephews, Hameed Haroon, as its CEO. When Yusuf Haroon returned from exile under the next government, and asked his brother to give him back <em>Dawn</em>, he was refused; therefore he filed a case against his brother, Mehmood Haroon, and his nephew, Hameed Haroon.</p> <p>Lady Abdoola Haroon who had appointed Begum Majeed Malik treasurer of two of her projects, used to tell her that if she did not keep a tight control over finances some of her male descendants would be in prison. Her daughter, Dr. Shaukat Haroon, was worried about her son Ali who was active as Hali Gali, this being a group of boys led by her son Ali and Ghazanfar Hidayatullah. She asked me to ask my brother to get Ali to do law and to join him in practice. Thus Ali and Lari came into existence in Dawn building. And when Hameed Haroon came back from studies abroad Begum Majeed Malik asked me to take him into the Heritage Foundation, but after he learnt the value of Heritage he resigned by writing in Chinese and took to dealing in Heritage artifacts. Despite his study of Chinese, he had not learnt the Confucian respect for his elders. The <em>Dawn</em> media group under him became a powerful mafia group as is clear from the next chapter on the Supreme Court of Pakistan.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
