<p>Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai belonged to village Paneli in princely state of Gondal in Kathiawar,
    Gujrat. They moved to Karachi in 1875 where a son was born to them in a rented apartment on the second floor of
    Wazir Mansion who was namedMahomedali. The boy lived for sometime in Bombay with an aunt where he studied at
    the Cathedral and John Connon School. Later he attended the&nbsp;<a title="Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam">Sindh-Madrasatul-Islam</a>and
    the&nbsp;<a title="Church Mission School" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Mission_School">Christian
        Missionary Society High School</a>in Karachi.In 1892, before leaving for London, he had an arranged
    marriage with his cousin,&nbsp;<a title="Emibai Jinnah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emibai_Jinnah">Emibai
        Jinnah</a>,from the ancestral village of Paneli. Jinnah's mother and wife both died during his absence in
    England.</p>
<p>MahomedaliJinnahbhaiwas sent to London by his father to be trained as a businessman, but the young
    man&nbsp;joined Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn to do his bar&nbsp;as soon as he realised that to be an England-returned
    barrister assured him a position in Indian upper class as against being a mere box walla.</p>
<p>He also was clever enough to learn to speak, dress and acquire the manners of an Englishman by becoming a part
    time Shakespearian actor on the London stage, and changed his name to Muhammad Ali Jinnah. According to Ms.
    Jinnah he used to act and recite from Shakespeare to keep himself and her amused.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;went to House of Commons to listen to&nbsp;Dadabhai Naoroji&nbsp;(4 September 1825 &ndash; 30 June
    1917), a Liberal Party member, and the first Indian to become a&nbsp;<a title="Parliament of the United Kingdom"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">British MP</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest Indian to be&nbsp;<a title="Call to the Bar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar">called
        to the bar</a>&nbsp;in England. At the age of 20, Jinnah began his practice in Bombay, the only Muslim
    barrister in the city. Jinnah attended the twentieth annual meeting of the Congress in Bombay in December 1904</p>
<p>Dadabhai Nauroji (1825-1917) was elected President of Congress thrice, and made Jinnah his secretary assuring
    him a place in the All India Congress hierarchy.</p>
<p>When leaders of the All India Muhammadan Educational conference founded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in Aligarh formed
    a delegation in 1906, to call on the new&nbsp;<a title="Viceroy of India" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy_of_India">Viceroy
        of India</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound,_4th_Earl_of_Minto">Lord
        Minto</a><u>, to seek safeguards for the Muslim minority</u>, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the
    newspaper&nbsp;<em>Gujarati</em>, asking what right the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian
    Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed. When they met in&nbsp;<a title="Dacca" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacca">Dacca</a>in
    December of that year to form the&nbsp;<a title="All-India Muslim League" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India
        Muslim League</a>, Jinnah did not attend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Jinnah opposed to separate electorates for Muslims, he used it to gain his first elective office in
    1909, as Bombay's Muslim representative on the&nbsp;<a title="Imperial Legislative Council" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Legislative_Council">Imperial
        Legislative Council</a>.</p>
<p>In December 1912, Jinnah addressed the annual meeting of the Muslim League although he was not a member. He
    joined it in the following year but remained a member of the Congress. In April 1913, he again went to Britain,
    with Gokhale, to meet with officials on behalf of the Congress. Jinnah led another delegation of the Congress
    to London in 1914, where he attended a reception for Gandhi who had come from South Africa, and returned home
    to India in January 1915.</p>
<p>In 1916, Jinnah who was a member of the Congress, became president of the Muslim League, and the two
    organisations signed the&nbsp;<a title="Lucknow Pact" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Pact">Lucknow
        Pact</a>, setting quotas for Muslims and Hindu representation in the various provinces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the war, Jinnah supported the British war effort, hoping that Indians would be rewarded with political
    freedoms. Jinnah joined the&nbsp;<a title="All India Home Rule League" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Home_Rule_League">All
        India Home Rule League</a>&nbsp;in 1916 of&nbsp;<a title="Annie Besant" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Besant">Annie
        Besant</a>&nbsp;and Tilak, to demand "<a title="Home rule" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule">home
        rule</a>" for India&mdash;the status of a self-governing&nbsp;<a title="Dominion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion">dominion</a>&nbsp;in
    the Empire similar to Canada, New Zealand and Australia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The All India Congress was founded by the British Allan Octavian Hume and Anglicized Parsis like Dadabhai
    Nauroji and Dinshaw Wacha in 1885, and had as its President non-Indian Britishers, George Yula (1888
    Allahabad), William Wedderburn (1889 Bombay and 1910 Allahabad)), Alfred Webb (1894 Madras), Henry Cotton (1904
    Bombay) and Annie Besant (1917 Calcutta), and Parsis Dadabhai Naoroji (1889 Calcutta, 1893 Lahore, 1906
    Calcutta), Mehta (1890 Calcutta) and Dinshaw (1901 Calcutta). Therefore the Quaid-i-Azam also mingled with the
    highly Anglicized Parsi community and married a Parsi girl,&nbsp;<a title="Rattanbai Petit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattanbai_Petit">Rattanbai
        Petit</a>&nbsp;("Ruttie"). As a result he was considered the rising star of Congress. But clever Jinnah, a
    Musla in Parsi language, had wooed at age of 38 a Parsi girl of 16, which was neither liked by her father nor
    by the influential Parsi community.Rattanbai defied her family and nominally&nbsp;<a title="Converted to Islam"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converted_to_Islam">converted to Islam</a>but never used the Muslim
    name Maryam Jinnah. The couple's only child, daughter&nbsp;<a title="Dina Wadia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Wadia">Dina</a>,
    was born on 15 August 1919.&nbsp; Ruttie's died in 1929, and Jinnah's sister&nbsp;<a title="Fatima Jinnah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Jinnah">Fatima</a>&nbsp;looked
    after him and his child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then Gandhi arrived with an international reputation for his struggle against racialism in South Africa with
    satyagaraha (truth-force), and the title of Mahatma (Great Soul). Gandhi attended Congress meetings in India by
    sitting on the floor rather than on the dais with leaders and cleaned toilets with the untouchables.He also
    encouraged villagers in Bihar to observe civil disobedience against the government by holding protests and
    strikes against their British masters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gandhi also joined the&nbsp;<a title="Khilafat Movement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khilafat_Movement">Khilafat</a>&nbsp;movement
    in support of the&nbsp;<a title="Ottoman caliphate" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_caliphate">Ottoman
        caliphate</a>against the British. Jinnah criticised Gandhi's Khilafat advocacy, which he saw as an
    endorsement of religious zealotry. Jinnah regarded Gandhi's proposed&nbsp;<em>satyagraha</em>&nbsp;campaign as
    political anarchy,and believed that self-government should be secured through constitutional means.At the 1920
    session of the Congress in&nbsp;<a title="Nagpur" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur">Nagpur</a>,&nbsp;Jinnah
    was shouted down by the delegates, who passed Gandhi's proposal, pledging&nbsp;<em>satyagraha</em>&nbsp;until
    India was independent. Jinnah did not attend the subsequent League meeting, held in the same city, which passed
    a similar resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress invested Gandhi in December 1921 with executive authority. Mahatama Gandhi
    reorganized the Congress with a new constitution, goal of&nbsp;<em>Swaraj&nbsp;</em>(independence) and
    the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadeshi_movement"><em>swadeshi</em>manifesto, i.e.&nbsp;</a>the
    boycott of the British-made goods He advocated&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadi"><em>khadi</em></a>(homespun
    cloth) to be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich
    or poor, to spend some time each day spinning&nbsp;<em>khadi</em>in support of the independence movement.</p>
<p>At the time of introducing the&nbsp;<a title="Montagu&ndash;Chelmsford Reforms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montagu%E2%80%93Chelmsford_Reforms">Montagu&ndash;Chelmsford
        Reforms</a>&nbsp;in 1919, the British Government declared that a commission would be sent to India after
    ten years to examine the effects and operations of the constitutional reforms and to suggest more reforms for
    India.&nbsp;In November 1927, the British government appointed a commission to report on India's constitutional
    progress for introducing constitutional reforms, as promised.&nbsp;<a title="Simon Commission" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Commission">The
        commission</a>, led by&nbsp;<a title="Liberal Party (United Kingdom)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(United_Kingdom)">Liberal</a>&nbsp;<a

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Simon,_1st_Viscount_Simon">John Simon</a>, arrived in India in
    March 1928.&nbsp;They were met with a boycott by India's leaders, Muslim and Hindu alike, angered at the
    British refusal to include their representatives on the commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Baldwin was defeated at the&nbsp;<a title="United Kingdom general election, 1929" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1929">1929
        British parliamentary election</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Ramsay MacDonald" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald">Ramsay
        MacDonald</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a title="Labour Party (United Kingdom)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(United_Kingdom)">Labour
        Party</a>&nbsp;became prime minister. MacDonald desired a conference of Indian and British leaders in
    London to discuss India's future, a course of action supported by Jinnah. Three&nbsp;<a title="Round Table Conferences (India)"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table_Conferences_(India)">Round Table Conferences</a>&nbsp;followed
    over as many years, none of which resulted in a settlement. Jinnah was a delegate to the first two conferences,
    but was not invited to the last.Heremained in Britain for most of the period 1930 through 1934, practising as a
    barrister before the&nbsp;<a title="Judicial Committee of the Privy Council" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council">Privy
        Council</a>, where he dealt with a number of India-related cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Quaid-i-Azam was again clever when he attracted leaders of Muslim majority provinces by promising them an
    autonomous, sovereign and independent states of their own vide the Lahore Resolution, 1940. Further, as a
    lawyer he propounded that&nbsp;565 princely states which comprised 45.3% of the surface of India, inhabited by
    103 million people would in terms of their treaty with British Crown become independent after the British left,
    and if they wished they would be in a position to form a separate independent state of 103 million, as compared
    to 110 million in Muslim majority provinces and 226 million in Hindu majority provinces. India, thus
    di&shy;vided into three or more independent units, Hindu India would not be in a position to dominate the
    Muslim group of states plus princely states, following the de&shy;parture of the British. He also thought of a
    corridor between East and West Muslim majority states. This had the support of Conservative party prime
    minister, Winston Churchill, who was in favour of many partitions of India, in order to create &lsquo;Pakistan,
    Hindustan, Princestan, etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Quaid-i-Azam was so taken by the idea that when he went to Madras, he invited the peo&shy;ple of South India
    to create a Dravidian grouping. At the 28th ses&shy;sion of the All-India Muslim League at Madras on 14 April
    1941, he said, &lsquo;This land is really Dravidistan ... I have every sympathy and shall do all to help, and
    you can establish Dravidistan where the seven per cent Muslim population will stretch out its hand of
    friendship and live with you on lines of security, justice and fair play.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Congress accused the Muslim League of working for the Balkanisation of India. The Quaid-i-Azam replied that
    freedom under Hindu hegemony would be a farce. The Congress cried out that the Muslim League had become an ally
    of British imperialism, and the Quaid-i-Azam retorted that the Muslim League &lsquo;would be the ally of the
    devil if need be in the interest of Muslims&rsquo;. He said that the reason was not &lsquo;because we are in
    love with imperialism; but in politics one has to play one&rsquo;s game as on a chessboard&rsquo; (Zaidi, Vol
    v, 96). However, Churchill lost the election and Nehru protested against the balkanization of India and got the
    majority of the states to join India with the help of Mountbatten, who conceded only a motheaten, mutilated and
    truncated Pakistan.</p>
<p>Quaid-i-Azam&rsquo;s acceptance of this a motheaten, mutilated and truncated Pakistan made Chaudhry Rahmat Ali
    (1897-1951),&nbsp;unhappy over a smaller Pakistan than the one he had conceived in his
    1933&nbsp;Cambridgepamphlet&nbsp;<em>Now Or Never</em>. He called it &lsquo;the greatest betrayal of the Millat
    in all her history&rsquo; and called Jinnah &lsquo;Judas, Mir Jaffer and Quisling-i-Azam&rsquo;.&nbsp;The<em>&ldquo;</em>Pakistan
    Times&rdquo;reported on May 22 1948 that&nbsp;Chaudhry Rahmat Ali came to Pakistan to launch&nbsp;a Pakistan
    National Liberation Movement with the object of securing a repudiation of the June 3 Plan, 'by agreement if
    possible and without agreement if necessary'. However, he was denied a Pakistani passport, and told to leave
    the country. The newspaper reported on 1<sup>st</sup>October 1948 that, &lsquo;The departure of the heartbroken
    Rahmat Ali from the country he named in 1933 relieves the Government of a severe headache&rsquo;.</p>
