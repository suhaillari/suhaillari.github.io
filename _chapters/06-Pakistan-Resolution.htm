title: 6. Pakistan Resolution
section: 1
---

<p>The Pakistan Resolution was actually passed by the All-India Muslim League Legislators&rsquo; Convention held in Delhi from 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;April 1946. This came about because the Muslims who had ruled over the sub-continent and ran a world empire for over a thousand years, did not want to be now ruled by the Hindu or the British, and therefore voted overwhelmingly for an independent Muslim state of Pakistan in the 1945-46 elections. After that, no Muslim League leader, not even the Quaid-i-Azam, who was looking for safeguards for Muslims, could go against it.&nbsp;</p> <p>A subjects committee comprising 10% of the Muslim League legislatures was formed to draft the resolution, and after five hours of deliberation, they submitted a resolution that was presented to the convention by Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy. The resolution stated &lsquo;That the zones comprising Bengal and Assam in the North-East and the Punjab, North West Frontier Province, Sindh and Baluchistan in the North-West of India, namely Pakistan zones where the Muslims are in a dominant majority, be constituted into a sovereign independent state and that an unequivocal undertaking be given to implement the establishment of Pakistan without delay.&rsquo; The resolution was unanimously passed and thereafter members stood up and took a pledge to be true to Pakistan, and also signed a pledge to that effect.</p> <p>However, on 3 June 1947, the Muslim majority provinces were asked to choose to be part of Pakistan after territorial adjustments as per Lahore (Pakistan) Resolution of 1940 proposed by the Quaid-i-Azam and opposed by Mr. Z. H. Lari in the subject committee on the evening of 22 March 1940. The Quaid-i-Azam, who had now begun to say that he would never accept a motheaten, mutilated and truncated Pakistan, gave his nod of ap&shy;proval to the plan and called a meeting of the All India Muslim League Council to confirm it. The council met at the Imperial Hotel, New Delhi, on Monday morning, June 9, 1947. According to the official minutes,&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Z.H. Lari who followed the Quaid-i-Azam, strongly condemned the plan for &lsquo;giving a truncated sovereign state to Muslim India&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>(S.S. Pirzada, page 567) (A.M. Zaidi, page 238).&nbsp;</p> <p>According to the minutes of the Muslim League meeting, &lsquo;Mr. Z.H. Lari, made a fervent appeal to the house to reject the plan&rsquo;. He said, &lsquo;In our Bombay session, we had rejected the Cabinet Mission&rsquo;s proposal only because the Congress had opposed grouping and had not accepted it in the sense in which the Cabinet Mission intended it to be implemented. The Congress had thereby insisted that Assam should not be included in Pakistan, and we never wanted Assam to be separated from Pakistan. When we have once rejected the Cabinet Mission plan on this basis, the question now arises whether today we will get Assam according to H.M.G.&rsquo;s plan or not. I want to tell the house that not only will we not get Assam, but also large portions of Punjab and Bengal have been divided and they will be lost of [sic] Pakistan.</p> <p><strong>&lsquo;&hellip; If on a matter of principle it is correct that Bengal and Punjab should be divided, then the Muslims who opposed the Congress Government in Bombay Presidency and the U.P. should be similarly given a separate homeland, because they in number far exceed the Sikh community</strong>. We undertake to transfer population in such a way that we would establish our majority in all the districts, which may be given to us in a divided U.P.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&lsquo;&hellip; If you were willing at last to accept this mutilated Pakistan, I want to put to you the question why did you create so much agitation, when you could have arrived at a compromise with the Congress on the basis of what you are willing to accept now, had been offered by the Congress leaders even four years back, and that if the Muslims are willing to accept it now there was no sense in all the bloodshed which had taken place.&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;(Appendix III. Appendices to Jinnah Papers Page 842).</p> <p>Mr. Lari tabled an amendment to the resolution moved by the Quaid-e-Azam, which said, &lsquo;Whereas the division of Punjab and Bengal is totally unacceptable, and whereas the scheme embodied in the June 3 plan does not provide any protection to the Muslim population of minority provinces of India, this council accepts the offer of Mr. Gandhi, made on 4 June 1947, to confer with the Congress with a view to devising an alternative to the June 3 plan, and postpones consideration of the June 3 plan to a later date to be fixed by the President.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Aftab Ahmed Khan, &lsquo;the Quaid-i-Azam, contrary to parliamentary practice, intervened in the debate from the chair and made a personal appeal to members to reject my father&rsquo;s amendment.&rsquo;</p> <p>Sardar Jafri wrote:</p> <p><em>&lsquo;Kaun azad hua</em></p> <p><em>Kis kay mathay say ghulami ki siyahi chuti</em></p> <p><em>Meray seenay main abhi dard hai mahkumi ka</em></p> <p><em>Madar-e hind kay chehray pay udasi hay wahi</em></p> <p><em>Khanjar azad hayn seenun main utternay kay liyya&rsquo;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
