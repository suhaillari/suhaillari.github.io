<p>The Dawn newspaper published on Saturday 11 June 2017, a full page &lsquo;ALLAHABAD 1930: AN ADDRESS TO REMEMBER&rsquo;, with text&nbsp; and photographs.</p> <p>Allama Sir Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was the greatest poet-philosopher of Islam who galvanized Muslims with stories of their conquests and his concepts of <em>Ishq,</em> <em>Khudi </em>and <em>Shaheen</em>.</p> <p><em>Ishq dam-e Jibrail, Ishq dil-e Mustafa</em></p> <p><em>Ishq khuda ka rasul, Ishq khuda ka kalam</em></p> <p><em>Khudi ko kar buland Itna, Ke her taqdeer say pehlay. </em></p> <p><em>Khuda banday say khud poochay, bata teri raza kiya hai.</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>Tu Shaheen hai parwaz hai kam tera</em></p> <p><em>Tere Samne Asman aur bhi hain</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Iqbal was invited to the Twenty-first session of the All-India Muslim League to be held at Allahabad from 29 to 31 December, 1930. He delivered his presidential address on 29 December, 1930 to an audience of about 600, which dwindled next morning to 25 persons lacking even the quorum of 75. Iqbal left after an hour and the session ended on the second day instead of lasting for three days.</p> <p>In his address, Iqbal had praised the All Parties Muslim Conference, a rival organization to the All India Muslim League presided over by the Aga Khan, which was joined by Seth Abdoola Haroon.</p> <p>Further, Iqbal put forward the idea of &lsquo;the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan amalgamated into a single State&rsquo;. He said that &lsquo;the North-West Indian Muslims will prove the best defenders of India against a foreign invasion, be that invasion one of ideas or of baynotes&rsquo;. In his address, Iqbal said, &lsquo;The Punjab with a 56 per cent of Muslim population supplies 54 per cent of total combatant troops in the Indian army&rsquo;, and if Gurkhas are excluded, &lsquo;the Punjab contingent amounts to 62 per cent of the whole Indian army&rsquo;.</p> <p>Therefore Iqbal said that, &lsquo;I have no hesitation in declaring that, if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the line of his own culture and traditions in his own homelands, is recognized as the basis of a permanent settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India&rsquo; He asserted that, &lsquo;This centralization &hellip; made the British rule possible in this country &hellip; It will intensify their sense of responsibility and deepen their patriotic feeling&rsquo;. &hellip; &lsquo;for Islam, an opportunity to rid itself of the stamp that Arabian Imperialism was forced to give it&rsquo;.</p> <p>Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal wrote a letter to Edward John Thompson of Oxford University on 4<sup>th</sup> March 1934 saying that &lsquo;I have just received your review of my book. It is excellent and I am grateful to you for the very kind things you have said of me. But you have made one mistake, which I hasten to point out as I consider it rather serious. You call me protagonist of the scheme called &ldquo;Pakistan&rdquo;. Now Pakistan is not my scheme. The one that I suggested in my address is the creation of a Muslim Province &ndash; i.e. a province having an overwhelming population of Muslims in the North-West of India. This new province will be, according to my scheme, a part of the proposed Indian Federation.&rsquo;.</p> <p><em>Sāre jahāṉ se acchā, Hindositāṉ&nbsp;hamārā</em><br /> <em>Ham bulbuleṉ haiṉ is kī, yih gulsitāṉ&nbsp;hamārā</em></p> <p>Better than the entire world, is our&nbsp;<a title="Etymology of India" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_India#Hindustan_and_Hind">Hindustan</a>,<br /> We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iqbal</p> <p>Therefore, <em>Dawn</em> distorts history when it writes that &lsquo;in his address, Sir Muhammad Iqbal sets out his vision of an independent state for the Muslim majority provinces of undivided India&rsquo;, because his vision in his address at Allahabad, did not include Muslims of the Muslim majority province of Bengal or of the Muslim minority provinces of India. His vision was of a province comprising martial races of the North-West of India, who with 62 per cent representation in the army could defend India, although he regretted that the British had not trained them to take responsibility above the rank of captain.</p> <p>The dream of Allama Iqbal was fulfilled when Bhutto refused to accept the government of majority party and the army surrendered whole of East Pakistan and big chunks of Shakargarh and Tharparkar in West Pakistan and Bhutto negotiated return of surrendered jawans and territory in West Pakistan in Delhi and established a new Pakistan in the West.</p> <p>The <em>Dawn</em> text also points out Yusuf Haroon standing next to a swanky car on 29 December 1930. This reminds me that Yusuf Haroon told me that &lsquo;if I had another life I would support Lari &hellip; every time because Lari always spoke the truth&rsquo;. Therefore if you want a true account of Pakistan then you should serialise my E book, which was put on the internet by a South African Lady but was hacked by some one who did not like the truth.</p> <p>Yours faithfully</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Suhail Zaheer Lari</p> <p>E6 Fourth Gizri Street, DHA-4, Karachi 75500</p> <p><a href="mailto:suhaillari@gmail.com">suhaillari@gmail.com</a></p> <p>0334 3103019</p> <p>021-35837520</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
