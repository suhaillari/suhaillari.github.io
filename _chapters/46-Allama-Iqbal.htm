<p>The Dawn newspaper published on Saturday 11 June 2017, a full page &lsquo;ALLAHABAD 1930: AN ADDRESS TO REMEMBER&rsquo;, with text and photographs.</p>

<p>Iqbal was invited to the Twenty-first session of the All-India Muslim League to be held at Allahabad from 29 to 31 December, 1930. He delivered his presidential address on 29 December, 1930 to an audience of about 600, which dwindled next morning to 25 persons lacking even the quorum of 75. Iqbal left after an hour and the session ended on the second day instead of lasting for three days.</p>

<p>It was because in his address, Iqbal was for All Parties Muslim Conference, founded by the Aga Khan, which wanted to bring together all the communities as against Muslim League which Aga Khan considered to be a communal organisation.</p>

<p>Further, Iqbal put forward the idea of &lsquo;the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan amalgamated into a single State&rsquo;. In his address, Iqbal said, &lsquo;The Punjab with a 56 per cent of Muslim population supplies 54 per cent of total combatant troops in the Indian army&rsquo;, and if Gurkhas are excluded, &lsquo;the Punjab contingent amounts to 62 per cent of the whole Indian army&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Therefore Iqbal said that, &lsquo;I have no hesitation in declaring that, if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the line of his own culture and traditions in his own homelands, is recognized as the basis of a permanent settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India... It will inntensify their sense of responsibility and their patriotic feeling. Thus, possessing full opportunity of development within the body-politic of India, the North West Indian Muslims will prove the best defenders of India against a foreign invasion, be that invasion one of ideas or bayonets... I therefore demand the formation of a consolidated Muslim state in the best interests of India and Islam. For India it means security and peace resulting from an internal balance of power; for Islam, an opportunity to rid itself of the stamp that Arabian imperialism was forced to give it, to mobilise its laws, its education, its culture, and to bring them into closure contact with its own original spirit and with the spirit of modern times&rsquo; (Zaidi, Vol iv, 66-68).&rsquo;</p>

<p>Although on the bases of the above address Iqbal has been hailed as the dreamer and originator of Pakistan idea but this has been contradicted by Iqbal himself. Iqbal wrote to EJ Thompson on 4 March 1934 &lsquo;I have just received your review of my book. It is excellent and I am grateful to you for the very kind things you have said of me. But you have made one mistake, which I hasten to point out as I consider it rather serious. You call me protagonist of the scheme called &ldquo;Pakistan&rdquo;. Now Pakistan is not my scheme. The one that I suggested in my address is the creation of a Muslim Province &ndash; i.e. a province having an overwhelming population of Muslims in the North-West of India. This new province will be, according to my scheme, a part of the proposed Indian Federation.&rsquo;. The photographic reproduction of this letter of Iqbal to EJ Thompson is in a booklet written by S. Hasan Ahmad of the Aligarh University in 1979 on <em>Iqbal: his political ideas at crossroads; a commentary on unpublshed letters to Prof. Thompson with photographic reproductions of the original letters. </em>Further, Khalid Ahmed writes in Friday Times, September 5-11,2003, that Muhammad Faridul Haq&#39;s book <em>Iqbal: Jahan-e-Deegar</em> (1983), contains a fascimile of a letter of Iqbal to Raghib Ahsan in which Iqbal clearly states; &#39;I propose to create a Muslim province within the Indian federation&#39;. Iqbal wrote the beautiful poem which is sometime used in India in place of its national anthem;</p>

<p><em>Sāre jahāṉ se acchā, Hindositāṉ&nbsp;hamārā</em><br />
<em>Ham bulbuleṉ haiṉ is kī, yih gulsitāṉ&nbsp;hamārā</em></p>

<p>Better than the entire world, is our&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_India#Hindustan_and_Hind">Hindustan</a>,<br />
We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode</p>

<p>Therefore, <em>Dawn</em> distorts history when it writes that &lsquo;in his address, Sir Muhammad Iqbal sets out his vision of an independent state for the Muslim majority provinces of undivided India&rsquo;. Allama Sir Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was one of the greatest poet-philosopher of Islam who gave Muslims fresh consciousness with stories of their conquests and put forward concepts of <em>Ishq,</em> <em>Khudi </em>and <em>Shaheen</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ishq </em>dam-e Jibrail, Ishq dil-e Mustafa</p>

<p>Ishq khuda ka rasul, Ishq khuda ka kalam</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Khudi </em>ko kar buland Itna, kay her taqdeer say pehlay</p>

<p>Khuda banday say khud poochay, bata teri raza kiya hai</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tu<em> Shaheen </em>hai parwaz hai kam tera</p>

<p>Tere Samnay Asman aur bhi hain</p>

<p>The <em>Dawn</em> also prints a picture of Yusuf Haroon standing next to a swanky car with Allama Iqbal sitting in it on 29 December 1930 at Allahabad. In fact, according to his son, Allama went to Allahabad by train and came back by train and walked round Allahabad on foot. This reminds me that Yusuf Haroon told me that &lsquo;if I had another life I would support Lari every time because Lari always spoke the truth&rsquo;. Therefore if you want a true account of Pakistan then you should read my e-book, which was put on the internet by a South African Lady but was hacked by some one who did not like the truth and has now been placed on internet in USA as <a href="http://www.suhaillaripakistan.com">www.suhaillaripakistan.com</a> or Suhail Lari Pakistan in 48 chapters and in South Africa as <a href="http://suhaillari.com">http://suhaillari</a> Legacy Unlocked or Suhail Lari Legacy Unlocked in 51 chapters.
