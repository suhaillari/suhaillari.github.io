<p>The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born on Monday, 12th Rabi al Awwal, in the year of the elephant, c. 571, in
    Mecca. He was forty years old in 610, when on a night in the month of Ramadan, the angel Gabriel came and asked
    him to &lsquo;Recite in the name of thy Lord who created man&rsquo;. The Prophet (PBUH) migrated from Mecca to
    Medina in 622. This became the first year of the Muslim calendar, beginning with 16 July, as the first day of
    the first month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;was a great prophet and a great general who possessed nine named swords, led
    his followers in eight major battles, and organized about a hundred raids inhis last ten years at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina">Medina</a>.
    He expelled Jewish tribes from Medina,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qainuqa">Banu Qaynuqa</a>in
    February 624, Banu Nadir in August 625, and Banu Qurayza in March 627.&nbsp;And&nbsp;attacked the Jews of
    Khyber outside Medina in May/June 628.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet dispatched an army in Jumada al-awwal 629, to take revenge for killing of his emissary at Mutah but
    all three of the commanders appointed by the Prophet were killed and Khalid ibin al-Walid brought back the army
    to Medina.&nbsp;The Prophet went to Mecca in triumph on 20 Ramadan 8/11 January 630 to become a Prophet (PBUH)
    with honour in his own country. Before he died at Medina on 13 Rabi al-Awwal 11/8 June 632, the prophet ordered
    an army to avenge the martyrs of battle of Mutah.</p>
<p>The Prophet&rsquo;s elder&nbsp;father-in-law, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, was proposed caliph (successor) by his younger
    father-in-law,&nbsp;Umar. On the first day of his caliphate, Abu Bakr ordered the army to fulfill the
    Prophet&rsquo;s command and march to Mutah. Thereafter, Caliph Abu Bakr organized armies for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridda_Wars">Ridda
        wars</a>(wars of apostasy) against those who had
    turned away from prophet on his death, and&nbsp;established an Islamic&nbsp;state in Arabia. This enabled
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_army">Muslims</a>to create the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires">largest
        pre-modern empire</a>that was&nbsp;planned by the&nbsp;Prophet Muhammad (pbuh),&nbsp;who had sent
    ambassadors to rulers of the states round him to accept Islam.</p>
<p>The first caliph, Abu Bakr (632-634), on his deathbed, nominated the Prophet Muhammad&rsquo;s (pbuh)younger
    father-in-law,&nbsp;Umar Al-Farooq&nbsp;(634-644), as the second caliph who assumed office on 23 August
    634.During the Ridda wars those who did not accept Islam and took up arms were killed or enslaved.&nbsp;Caliph
    Umar freed thousands of Bedouin Arab enslaved during the Ridda wars. He expelled Christians and Jews from
    Arabia, and occupied&nbsp;the most heavily Christian areas in the world.&nbsp;Jerusalem fell in February
    638.&nbsp;Syria was conquered in 634-641, and Egypt in 639-642.</p>
<p>Persian empire comprising Iraq and Iran was conquered in 633-655. The Persian slaves in Medina chose&nbsp;a
    Persian slave,&nbsp;<a title="Piruz Nahavandi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piruz_Nahavandi">Firuz
        Nahavandi</a>&nbsp;Abu&nbsp;Lulu,&nbsp;to&nbsp;attack Umar while he was leading the morning prayers at
    Al-Masjid al-Nabawi. He wounded Umar and twelve others. Six did not survive. Caliph Umar died three days later
    on Wednesday, 3<sup>rd</sup>November 644 (26<sup>th</sup>Dhu al-Hijja 23). It was followed by rebellion all
    over conquered Persian Empire.</p>
<p>Caliph Umar nominated a council of six to elect his successor, who chose a first cousin of the Prophet, son of
    adaughter of Um Hakim bint Abdul Mutalib,and elder son-in-law of the Prophet, Usman AL-Ghani, known as Dhu
    al-Nurayn (of two lights), because he married to two daughters of the Prophet, firstly Ruqayyah and upon her
    death to Kulsoom. Caliph Usman consolidated the Islamic conquest and brought prosperity which created rivalry
    among the tribes. Caliph Usman (644-656), was surrounded by dissidents from Egypt, Kufa and Basra, and killed
    while he was fasting and reciting the Quran in his house at Medina, and another cousin of the Prophet, i.e. son
    of his father&rsquo;s brother and the Prophet&rsquo;s younger son-in-law, Ali (656-661), took over.</p>
<p>The failure of Caliph Ali to punish the murderers of his predecessor ran counter to the Quranic law of&nbsp;<em>Qisas&nbsp;</em>(Retaliation),
    and the traditional belief in tribal honour, which required every member of an Arab tribe to avenge the murder
    of one of their member, and stipulated that the heir was the man who accepted the responsibility for avenging
    the death. Muawiya, who was brother-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), leader of the Banu Umayya and the
    Governor of Syria, demanded that murderer of Caliph Usman be punished. This led to the di&shy;vision of the
    caliphate. Caliph Muawiya ruled the western part of the caliphate from Damascus in Syria, while Caliph Ali
    ruled the eastern part of the caliphate from Kufa in Iraq.</p>
<p>The Kharijites (seceders), partisan of Ali&rsquo;s party did not agree with the division. They decided to kill
    both the caliphs on the same day during the early morning prayers. Caliph Muawiya in Damascus escaped with
    minor injuries, but Caliph Ali in Kufa received fatal injuries and died on&nbsp;21<sup>st</sup>of Ramzan /26
    January 661.&nbsp;Ali&rsquo;s elder son Hasan fulfilled Qisas by killing Ali&rsquo;s murderer and was declared
    caliph as successor of Ali butentered into a pact with Caliph Muawiya, whereby he gave up the caliphate on 10
    August 661, in fulfillment of a saying of the Prophet Muhammad&rsquo;s (PBUH), &lsquo;This son of mine is a
    Sayyid, and he will unite two branches of the Muslims&rsquo;. In celebration of this meri&shy;torious deed of
    reconciling the opposing parties, the year is known as &lsquo;Am al-Jama&rsquo;a, the Year of Community (Jafri,
    1979, 156). Imam Hasan died nine years later at Medina in AH 49/AD 669.</p>
<p>Under the Umayyad caliphate (661-750),&nbsp;Muslim armies conquered all of Christian North Africa,&nbsp;Spain,
    Portugal, Andorra and part of France.In the east, theyconquered Bukhara and Samarqand in 706&ndash;712,
    and&nbsp;Sindh in 711-714.</p>
<p>The successful challenge to the Umayyad&rsquo;s came as per the tribal system from the family of Abbas who was
    uncle of the Prophet (PBUH), and eldest male member of the Prophet&rsquo;s family at the time of his death. It
    was natural for an Arab to accept Abbas as heir to the Prophet (PBUH), because the eldest male of the tribe was
    considered by them to be the main recipient of the inheritance. The claim of Abbas&rsquo;s family also received
    support from the offspring of younger brother of Hasan and Husain named Muhammad, who was a son of Caliph Ali
    from &lsquo;a blackish slave girl from Sindh&rsquo; (Ibn Saad, Book V, 105). He was known as Ibn Hanafiyya, to
    distinguish him from another son of Caliph Ali by that name from another wife. The imamate of Muhammad, son of
    Caliph Ali, and after his death that of Abu Hashim, son of Muhammad, was recognised by Shiites in preference to
    those members of the family of Caliph Ali who had taken to political inactivity and prayers. As Abu Hashim had
    no son, he made Muhammad, an offspring of Abbas, his nominee to the imamate and gave him letters addressed to
    Shiite circles in Khurasan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Muhammad, a great grandson of Abbas, conceived a plan for seizure of power from the Umayyad&rsquo;s, which
    upon his death in 743, was put into operation by his son Ibrahim. It received active support in the province of
    Khurasan where Abu Muslim, a non-Arab, unfurled the black banner of the Abbasids in June 747 and occupied the
    provincial capital Merv (now in Turkmenistan). As Ibrahim had been captured in 748 and had died in captivity,
    his brother Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah received the oath of allegiance as caliph in the mosque of Kufa on 28
    November 749.</p>
<p>Although Abbasids tried to kill the entire Umayyad family, Abd ar-Rahman, escaped and established an independent
    kingdom in 756 in Andalusia (Spain) where most of the local population converted to Islam by the tenth
    century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muslim forces&nbsp;<a title="History of Islam in southern Italy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Islam_in_southern_Italy">captured

<p>Instead of militia of Arab warriors who were riddled with factions, the Abbasid caliphs began to hire slave
    troops.The Shia Buyid troops from Daylam (on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea) employed by the Abbasids
    kept control of Baghdad for over a century.&nbsp;And independent dynasties emerged in the East, like the
    Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids and Ghaznavids. A Shiite Fatimid caliphate (909-1171) came into power in North
    Africa, and built their capital al-Qahirah (Cairo) in 973.</p>
<p>In 1055, the Sunni Seljuq Turks under Tughril Beg (1016-1063) took control&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Baghdad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad">Baghdad</a>&nbsp;fromthe<a

    Book of&nbsp;<a title="Government" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government">Government</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;He
    appointedAbū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī(405-505/1058 &ndash;1111) as head of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizamiyya">Nizamiyya</a>madrassa
    in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad">Baghdad</a>. Al-Ghazali wrote more than 70 books on
    science, philosophy and Sufism.He wrote&nbsp;<em>Tahafut al-Falasifa</em>(The Destruction of Philosophy), as he
    saw in philosophy a danger to correct faith.&nbsp;Al-Ghazali&rsquo;s&nbsp;work,&nbsp;<em>Ihya al-Ulum al-Din</em>(The
    Revival of the Religious Sciences), provided the parameters within which a revived Islam was confined.&nbsp;He
    brought orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together. To him the ultimate value was only in the mystical
    experience (<em>nubuwwa</em>)<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>that is attained as a result of following<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi">Sufi</a>practices.Thus
    Muslim world moved toward an increasingly theologically enclosed culture that could no longer promote original
    scientific research, while Europe was once again becoming aware of the glorious heritage of Greek science and
    philosophy.</p>
<p>The majority of Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) did not appoint a successor, and regard the
    first four caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman and Ali as close companions of the Prophet and the rightly guided
    caliphs.</p>
<p>However today about 13% Muslims are Shi&rsquo;atu Ali (partisan of Ali) who&nbsp;believe that the Prophet&nbsp;<a
        title="Muhammad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Muhammad</a>&nbsp;(PBUM)&nbsp;nominated&nbsp;
    his cousin and son-in-law&nbsp;<a title="Ali" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali">Ali&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;as
    his successor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A majority of Shias, about 85 percent are Twelvers who believe that after the death of elder son of
    Imām&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Ja'far al-Sadiq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja%27far_al-Sadiq">Ja'far
        al-Sadiq</a>&nbsp;(702&ndash;765), his younger surviving son Musa al-Kazim became Imam and his descendent
    the twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi.</p>
<p>The Zaidiyyah Shias believe that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers, therefore Zayd was the rightful
    5th imam since he was killed fighting tyranny and corruption.</p>
<p>Batiniyyah Sevener&nbsp;believe that&nbsp;Isma'il&nbsp;&nbsp;(721&ndash;755), the predeceased elder son of
    Ja'far al-Sadiq (702&ndash;765) was the divinely appointed 6<sup>th</sup><a title="Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imamah_(Ismaili_doctrine)">Imam</a>who
    was succeeded by his son,

<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Qarmatians" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qarmatians">Qarmatians</a>believe that the
    Imams are in occultation, who communicate and teach their followers through a network of&nbsp;<a title="Dawah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawah">dawah</a>(Missionaries).The
    Qarmaṭians considered the pilgrimage
    to Mecca a superstition. They sacked Mecca and&nbsp;<a title="Medina" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina">Medina</a>&nbsp;in
    930, and desecrated the Zamzam Well with corpses of&nbsp;<a title="Hajj" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj">Hajj</a>&nbsp;pilgrims
    and took away the Black Stone from Mecca.</p>
<p>The Nizari Mawla of Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah (1034-1124) founded a group of&nbsp;<a title="Fedayeen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedayeen">fedayeen</a>known
    as&nbsp;<a title="Assassins" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins"><em>Hashshashin</em></a>, or
    Assassins who assassinatedthe Seljuq vazir&nbsp;Nizam al-Mulk on 10&nbsp;<a title="Ramadan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a>&nbsp;485
    A.H.(14 October 1092). The Seljuq ruler Malik Shah (1072-1092) was assassinated the same year, which resulted
    in a war of succession and dismemberment of the Seljuk Empire.</p>
<p>The Pope Urban II at the town of Clermont called the first crusade by Christians against Muslims in November
    1095in central France, which was to depart on 15 August 1096. The pope made the proposal: 'Whoever for devotion
    alone, but not to gain honour or money, goes to Jerusalem to liberate the Church of God can substitute this
    journey for all penance.' The reaction to Pope's appeal was astounding as thousands saw this as a new way to
    attain salvation and to avoid the consequences of their sinful lives.</p>
<p>However, before that&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_the_Hermit">Peter the Hermit</a>, led a "<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Crusade">People's Crusade</a>" of about 20,000 people towards
    the Holy Land after Easter 1096.&nbsp;The Seljuqs easily defeated the untrained&nbsp;<a title="People's Crusade"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Crusade">People's Crusade</a>.&nbsp;They&nbsp;ambushed them
    outside Nicaea with only about 3000 people escaping.But they could not stop the progress of the army of the
    subsequent&nbsp;<a title="Princes' Crusade" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes%27_Crusade">Princes'
        Crusade</a>,which set off from France and Italy on 15 August 1096.They took the city of Nicaea in June
    1097.&nbsp;The first Crusader State, the County of Edessa, came into being under Count Baldwin of Boulogne in
    1098.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 1099 the crusaders captured the Holy Land and&nbsp;established three more states: those&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem">of
        Jerusalem</a>,&nbsp;Antiochand&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Tripoli">Tripoli</a>,
    andbegan to take control of the coastline with the support of the Italian trading cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Seljuqs appointed&nbsp;Imad ad-Din&nbsp;<a title="Zengi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zengi">Zengi</a>of
    Oghuz Turk origin&nbsp;<a title="Atabeg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atabeg">as atabeg</a>(governor)

    Edessa on 24 December 1144, which was the first city to fall to the Crusaders, and became the first to be
    recaptured by the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news of this disaster prompted Pope Eugenius III to issue an appeal for the second crusade (1145-49).King
    Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany&nbsp;led armies from France and Germany to Jerusalem and
    Damascus without winning any major victories.</p>
<p>After the assassination of Imad ad-Din Zengi in 1146, his sons&nbsp;<a title="Saif ad-Din Ghazi I" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif_ad-Din_Ghazi_I">Saif
        ad-Din Ghazi I</a>and&nbsp;Nur ad-Din,&nbsp;divided the kingdom between themselves. In 1149, Nur ad-Din
    defeated Raymond, Prince&nbsp;<a title="Principality of Antioch" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Antioch">of
        Antioch</a>, seizing several crusader castles in the north of Syria, defeated an attempt by&nbsp;<a title="Joscelin II of Edessa"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joscelin_II_of_Edessa">Joscelin II</a>&nbsp;to recover the&nbsp;<a title="County of Edessa"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Edessa">County of Edessa</a>, and
    captured Damascus.</p>
<p>In 1163,&nbsp;<a title="Shawar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawar">Shawar</a>, the vazir to the&nbsp;<a
        title="Fatimid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid">Fatimid</a>&nbsp;caliph&nbsp;<a title="Al-Adid"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Adid">al-Adid</a>,&nbsp;askedfor&nbsp;Nur ad-Din&rsquo;s help
    against his rival Dirgham. Nur ad-Din sent his Kurdish commander Shirkuh, who restored Shawar as Vazir but kept
    the control of Egypt. Shawar was dissatisfied and asked Amalric, crusader king of Jerusalem, for help.
    Christian Amalric and Shia Shawar besieged Sunni Shirkuh at Bilbeis. Shirkuh retreated to Alexander where he
    left his nephew Saladin to guard the city. To relieve Shirkuh, Nur-ad-Din moved against the crusader state of
    Antioch. Amalric went back so did Shirkuh and Shawar was left with Egypt.</p>
<p>Shirkuh returned in 1166 to take back Egypt. Once again the Crusader King of Jerusalem came to Shawar&rsquo;s
    aid. Saladin helped his uncle Shirkuh to move to&nbsp;<a title="Alexandria" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>&nbsp;where&nbsp;the
    besieged Shirkuh agreed to leave Egypt alone in return for a Crusader withdrawal. Amalric left with a favorable
    treaty resulting in Egyptian tribute to Jerusalem and a friendly Shawar in control.</p>
<p>Amalric launched an attack against&nbsp;<a title="Bilbeis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbeis">Bilbeis</a>in1168,
    Shawar appealed to Damascus and Shirkuh returned and fought off Amalric.&nbsp;The Fatimid vazir, Shawar, was
    assassinated and Shirkuh died in 1169. Saladin took over as vazir of the Fatimid Caliph, al-Adid. However, a
    group of Egyptian soldiers and amirs attempted to assassinate Saladin,and 50,000 black African soldiers from
    the regiments of the Fatimid army opposed Saladin's rule. Saladin crushed the uprising by 23 August 1169 and
    after that he never again had to face a military challenge from Cairo.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1169, Saladin, with reinforcements from Nur ad-Din, defeated a massive&nbsp;Crusader-<a title="Byzantine Empire"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;force near&nbsp;<a title="Damietta"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damietta">Damietta</a>. In 1170, Nur ad-Din sent Saladin&rsquo;s father
    to Egypt at his request, as he had begun granting his family members high-ranking positions to strengthen his
    support base. Saladin also ordered the construction of a college for the&nbsp;<a title="Maliki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maliki">Maliki</a>&nbsp;branch
    of Sunni Islam in the city, and one for the&nbsp;<a title="Shafi'i" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi%27i">Shafi'i</a>&nbsp;denomination
    to which he belonged in&nbsp;<a title="Al-Fustat" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Fustat">al-Fustat</a>.</p>
<p>After establishing himself in Egypt, Saladin launched a campaign against the Crusaders besieging&nbsp;<a title="Deir al-Balah"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah">Darum</a>&nbsp;in 1170.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also attacked and
    captured the Crusader castle of&nbsp;<a title="Eilat" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilat">Eilat</a>,
    built on an island off the head of the&nbsp;<a title="Gulf of Aqaba" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aqaba">Gulf
        of Aqaba</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nur ad-Din wrote to Saladin in June 1171, to establish the Abbasid caliphate in Egypt. Fatimid caliph Al-Adid
    died on 13 September 1171, and five days later, the Abbasid&nbsp;<a title="Khutba" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khutba"><em>khutba</em></a>&nbsp;was
    pronounced in Cairo and al-Fustat, proclaiming&nbsp;<a title="Al-Mustadi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mustadi">al-Mustadi</a>as
    caliph.&nbsp;When Nur ad-Din diedin 1174, Saladin took over Damascus and proceeded to reduce other cities
    previously held by Nur ad-Din.&nbsp;The combined forces of Mosul and Aleppo marched against Saladin who won and
    proclaimed himself king. The Abbasid caliph declared him "Sultan of Egypt and Syria."&nbsp;Saladin received
    threats from the&nbsp;<a title="Ismailism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismailism">Ismaili</a>&nbsp;"<a
        title="Assassins" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins">Assassins</a>", led by&nbsp;<a title="Rashid ad-Din Sinan"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_ad-Din_Sinan">Rashid ad-Din Sinan</a>.On 11 May 1175 a group of
    thirteen Assassins gained admission into Saladin's camp, but were detected and killed. Once while Saladin was
    resting in one of his captain's tents, an assassin rushed forward at him and struck at his head with a
    knife.&nbsp;Saladin had his guards supplied with link lights and had chalk and cinders strewed around his tent
    outside&nbsp;<a title="Masyaf" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masyaf">Masyaf</a>&mdash;which he was
    besieging&mdash;to detect the Assassins.&nbsp;One night Saladin's guards noticed a spark glowing down the hill
    of Masyaf and then vanishing among the Ayyubid tents. Saladin awoke to find a note pinned by a poisoned dagger.
    The note threatened that he would be killed if he didn't withdraw.&nbsp;Saladin made an alliance with Sinan and
    his Assassins and&nbsp;left for Egypt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saladin returned in November 1177 to fight crusaders. Saladin and his men were surprised near Ramla on 25
    November and suffered heavy losses. Saladin won a victory in the spring of 1178, at Hama. He ordered one of his
    generals, Farrukh-Shah, to guard the Damascus frontier with a thousand men, retire in case of attack, avoiding
    battle, and light warning beacons on the hills. In April 1179, the Crusaders led by King Baldwin expecting no
    resistance, advanced in pursuit of Farrukh-Shah's force,&nbsp;and were defeated by the Ayyubids. In the spring
    of 1180, while Saladin was in the area of&nbsp;<a title="Safad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safad">Safad</a>,
    to commence a campaign against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, King Baldwin sent messengers to him with proposals of
    peace. Saladin agreed to a truce.&nbsp;<a title="Raymond III of Tripoli" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_III_of_Tripoli">Raymond
        of Tripoli</a>&nbsp;denounced the truce but was compelled to accept after an Ayyubid raid on his territory

    was forced to leave on arrival of a relief force under King Baldwin IV. Saladin returned to Kerak again in 1184
    with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late May 1187, Saladin assembled the largest army he had ever commanded, around some 30,000&nbsp;men
    including about 12,000&nbsp;regular cavalry. The opposing Crusader army consisted of around 20,000&nbsp;men,
    including 1,200&nbsp;knights from Jerusalem and Tripoli and 50 from Antioch. Saladin annihilated the Crusader
    force led by<a title="Guy of Lusignan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_of_Lusignan">Guy of Lusignan</a>,&nbsp;<a

    a turning point in the history of the Crusades.The Christian cities surrendered one by one; Jerusalem
    surrendered on October 2, 1187 after 88 years with Christians. Only some of the ports remained with the
    Christians.</p>
<p>The Pope Urban III was said to have died of a heart attack at the news and his successor, Gregory VIII, issued
    an emotive crusade appeal and the rulers of Europe began to organise their forces for third crusade
    (1189-1192). Frederick Barbarossa's German army successfully defeated the Seljuq Turks in Asia Minor only for
    the emperor to drown crossing a river in southern Turkey and Saladin escaped facing this formidable
    enemy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Franks in the Levant had managed to cling onto the city of Tyre and were besieging the most important port
    on the coast, Acre. It was here in the summer of 1190 that Philip Augustus and Richard the Lionheart landed.
    The city surrendered and Philip returned home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The armies of Saladin faced the army of King Richard at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a title="Battle of Arsuf" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arsuf">Battle
        of Arsuf</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;7 September 1191, and suffered heavy losses. Richard occupied Jaffa, restoring
    the city's fortifications. Saladin moved south, where he dismantled the fortifications of Ascalon to prevent
    it, from falling into Crusader hands.</p>
<p>In October of 1191, Richard began restoring the inland castles on the coastal plain beyond Jaffa in preparation
    for an advance on Jerusalem. During this period, Richard and Saladin passed envoys back and forth, negotiating
    the possibility of a truce.&nbsp;Richard proposed that his sister,&nbsp;<a title="Joan of England, Queen of Sicily"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_England,_Queen_of_Sicily">Joan of England, Queen of Sicily</a>,&nbsp;should
    marry Saladin's brother and that Jerusalem could be their wedding gift&nbsp;However, Saladin rejected this idea
    when Richard insisted that Saladin's brother convert to Christianity</p>
<p>In January 1192, Richard's army occupied Beit Nuba, just twelve miles from Jerusalem, but withdrew without
    attacking the Holy City. Instead, Richard advanced south on Ascalon, where he restored the fortifications. In
    July of 1192, Saladin tried to threaten Richard's command of the coast by attacking Jaffa. Saladin very nearly
    captured it, however, Richard arrived a few days later and defeated Saladin's army in a battle outside the
    city.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Battle of Jaffa (1192)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jaffa_(1192)">Battle of
        Jaffa (1192)</a>&nbsp;proved to be the last military engagement of the Third Crusade. After Richard
    reoccupied Jaffa and restored its fortifications, he and Saladin again discussed terms. At last Richard agreed
    to demolish the fortifications of Ascalon, while Saladin agreed to recognize Crusader control of the
    Palestinian coast from Tyre to Jaffa. The Christians would be allowed to travel as unarmed pilgrims to
    Jerusalem.&nbsp;Saladin died of a fever on 4 March 1193, at&nbsp;<a title="Damascus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus">Damascus</a>,not
    long after King Richard's departure.</p>
<p>The Fourth Crusaders (1201-1204) came to an abrupt halt as the Pope Innocent III excommunicated the entire
    Crusade for attacking and looting Constantinople, the greatest Christian city in the world.</p>
<p>In the Fifth Crusade&nbsp;(1217-1221), the Crusaders attacked Egypt from both land and sea,&nbsp;but became
    bogged down outside the port of Damietta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Sixth Crusade in 1229, Emperor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/frederick-ii-prussia">Frederick
        II</a>achieved the peaceful transfer of Jerusalem to Crusader control through negotiation with Kamil. The
    Muslims took back Jerusalem a decade later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prompted the Seventh Crusade (1239-41), led by Thibault IV of Champagne who recaptured Jerusalem but it was
    lost again in 1244.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1249,&nbsp;King (later Saint) Louis IX of Franceled the Eighth Crusade against Egypt, which ended in
    defeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1250, when the&nbsp;<a title="Ayyubid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayyubid">Ayyubid</a>&nbsp;sultan&nbsp;<a

    abdicated, Aybak ruled from
    1250 to 1257.</p>
<p>When Mongke Khan was installed as the Great Khan in 1251, he&nbsp;selected his brother, Hulagu, to conquer the
    Muslim states.&nbsp;Hulagu's Mongol army set out for Baghdad in November 1257 and&nbsp;laid siege to the city
    on January 29, 1258. Baghdad surrendered on 10 February 1258.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1260,&nbsp;Hulagu demanded that Mamluk Sultan Saif ad Din Qutuz in Cairo should surrender. However, Mongke
    Khan died and Hulagu had to return to Mongolia for the election of a new Khan. Upon receiving news of Hulagu's
    departure, Sultan Qutuz quickly assembled a large army in Cairo, which defeated the Mongols at Ayn Jalut, where
    David had once humbled the giant Goliath.</p>
<p>On way back to Cairo, Sultan Qutuz was assassinated and Abu al-Futuh (Father of conquests)&nbsp;<a title="Baibars"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baibars">Bai (chief) bars</a>(panther)took over as Sultan of Egypt, a
    move which was contested by Sinjar al-Halabi whoclaimed Damascus. Baibars defeated Sinjar on 17 January 1261
    and occupied Damascus, thereafter the Ayyubid Amirs of Homs and Hama who had staved off the Mongols also
    submitted to him.&nbsp;When the Abbasid refugee Abu al-Qasim Ahmad, the uncle of the last Abbasid caliph&nbsp;<a
        title="Al-Musta'sim" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Musta%27sim">al-Musta&lsquo;sim</a>, arrived in
    Cairo in 1261, Baibars had him proclaimed caliph as&nbsp;<a title="Al-Mustansir (Cairo)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mustansir_(Cairo)">al-Mustansir
        II</a>&nbsp;and duly received investiture as sultan from him.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;al-Mustansir II was
    killed in an expedition to recapture Baghdad from the Mongols. In 1262, another Abbasid who had survived from
    the defeated expedition, was proclaimed caliph as&nbsp;<a title="Al-Hakim I" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hakim_I">al-Hakim
        I</a>.In 1263, Baibars laid siege to&nbsp;<a title="Acre, Israel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel">Acre</a>,

    1270, Prince Edward of England arrived in Acre in May 1271 who survived an assassination attempt organised by

<p>In 1272 Baibars invaded the&nbsp;<a title="Kingdom of Makuria" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Makuria">Kingdom
        of Makuria</a>, headed by King David I. Baibars' invasion of Makuria continued for four years until by

<p>In 1291,&nbsp;<a title="Acre, Israel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel">Acre</a>, the last major
    Crusader fortress in the Holy Land fell to the forces of the Mamluk Sultan, al-Ashraf Khalil of Egypt, and any
    remaining territories on the mainland were lost over the next decade.</p>
<p>One product of the Crusades and the Mongol invasion was Taqi ad-Din Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328). Ibn
    Taymiyyah&rsquo;s family had to leave their hometown of Harran which was completely destroyed by the Mongols
    and settle in Damascus. After the death of his&nbsp;father in 1284, he took his place as the head of the
    Sukkariyya madrassa giving lessons on the Hadith. A year later, as chair of the&nbsp;Hanbali<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawiya_(institution)">Zawiya</a>at
    the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Mosque">Umayyad Mosque</a>, he started teaching&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir">tafsir</a>on Fridays.</p>
<p>In 1293, Ibn Taymiyyah issued a Fatwa saying that any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, who insulted Muhammad must
    be killed. In 1310, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote against visiting the tombs of prophets and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali">saints</a>.
    According to Ibn Taymiyyah, seeking the assistance of God through intercession is allowed, as long as the other
    person is still alive. But those who ask assistance from the grave of the Prophet or saints, are engaged
    in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirk_(Islam)">shirk</a>.</p>
<p>To Ibn Taymiyyah, the role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaf">Salaf</a>);
    which constituted Muhammad's&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahabah">companions</a>, the Sahaba
    (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi%E2%80%98un">Tabi'un</a>(second generation) and then the generation
    after the Tabi'un known as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi%E2%80%98_al-Tabi%E2%80%98in">Tabi'
        Al-Tabi'in</a>(third generation). Any deviation from their practice was bid&lsquo;ah (innovation), and was
    forbidden by Ibn Taymiyyah.</p>
<p>Ibn Taymiyyah wrote that, "It is in jihad that one can live and die in ultimate happiness, both in this world
    and in the hereafter. Abandoning it means losing entirely or partially both kinds of happiness." He believed in
    taking the initiative in fighting those who did not observe unambiguous obligations and prohibitions, until
    they undertook to perform the prescribed prayers, to pay&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat">zakat</a>,
    to fast during the month of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a>, and to make the
    pilgrimage to Mecca. He made a declaration of apostasy (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfir">takfir</a>)
    against a Muslim who did not obey Islam, and considered it a duty to oppose and kill Muslim rulers who did not
    implement the revealed law (shari'a). He declared the Mongol ruler Ghazan and other Mongols who did not accept
    shari'a in full, to be unbelievers. Ibn Taymiyyah affirmed that Jihad against the Mongols, "was obligatory,
    because the latter ruled not according to Sharīʿah but through their traditional, and therefore man made,&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yassa">Yassa</a>code. He called for a defensive jihad to mobilise the
    people to kill the Mongol rulers and anyone who supported them, Muslim or non-Muslim. According to Ibn
    Taymiyyah, everyone who was with the Mongols, in the state over which they ruled had to be regarded as
    belonging to the most evil class of men. He was either an atheist&nbsp;(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zind%C4%ABq">zindīq</a>)
    or a hypocrite who did not believe in the essence of the religion of Islam. This meant that he outwardly
    pretended to be Muslim but belonged to the worst class of all people who were the people of the bida`
    (heretical innovations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the Alawites as heritical and campaigned against Shias. He considered Husain's
    martyrdom a divinely bestowed honour&mdash;not a tragedy, and that the Islamic response to such loss is not
    extravagant mourning but to endure the loss with patience and trust in God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibn Taymiyyah also criticized Mutakallimun for their use of kalam, rationalist theology and philosophy. To Ibn
    Taymiyyah the usul al-din of the Mutakallimun, deserved to be named usul din al-shaytan (principles of Satanic
    religion).</p>
<p>According toIbn Taymiyyah,&nbsp;Tauheed is the most essential element of Islam. It means one nation under one
    Allah, i.e. Khilafat. The Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) established the Islamic state according to the Quran,
    performing the political and religious duties simultaneously. Muslim fragmentation is because of the loss of a
    sacred central authority of Khalifah, where the government is established according to the commandments of
    Quran, with Allah being the supreme and sovereign ruler of the state. Man cannot be the sovereign.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than half&nbsp;of the European portion of what is now Russia and Ukraine, were under the
    suzerainty of&nbsp;Muslim&nbsp;<a title="Tatars" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars">Tatars</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

    the territory of present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and
    Hungary.&nbsp;The Ottomans conquered&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace">Thrace</a>and much

<p>In 1517, Ottoman Sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluks and made Egypt part of the Ottoman Empire.The Abbasid
    Caliph&nbsp;Al-Mutawakkil III was captured and transported to&nbsp;<a title="İstanbul" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0stanbul">Constantinople</a>.
    He formally surrendered the title of caliph as well as its outward emblems &mdash;&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a title="Relics of Muhammad"

    the Ottomans established the caliphate (1517-1925) in Turkey.</p>

        naval campaign</a>, which lasted from 1570 to 1573, resulted in the Ottoman control of much of the
    Mediterranean Sea, which was once called by the Romans&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Nostrum"><em>Mare
            Nostrum</em></a>(Latin, "Our Sea"). Further, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_pirates">Barbary

<p>Thus, in about nine hundred years, Muslim armies had encircled, captured and invaded Christian Europe from all
    sides but the north. From Spain in the west, they attacked France, from the Mediterranian in the south they
    attacked Italy and from Turkey in the East, they attacked Vienna.&nbsp;According to an estimate in 2012, one
    out five people in the world were Muslim (22.32%), making Islam&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups">second-largest
        religion in the world</a>after Christianity (31.50%).</p>
